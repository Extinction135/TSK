Level / Puzzle Design Guidelines

employ fincher's technique: ask a question, then let the viewer
discover the answer. don't tell them about it, lead them to it.
setup the puzzle, but let them solve it. don't hold their hand.
drawing out the moment here can be done by intentionally leaving
out hints or info needed to solve the puzzle.

miyamoto does this properly in lttp, poorly in zelda 1, and then
far too obviously in every other zelda game since lttp. so, bite
lttp's setup here - not obvious, but there.






Game Design Guidelines

we should cater to each tier of player:
newbie: there are easy and fun things to do in each level, interaction.
novice: dungeons are challenging, bosses are fun.
advanced: the shadow dungeon and boss exist for these folks.
expert: optional quests and bosses exist for these folks.








Overworld Design Direction

the overworld MUST CHANGE when link accomplishes certain things.
when link beats a castle, the castle crumbles on the map.
when link beats a temple, the temple crumbles on the map.
when link beats a dungeon, the boss location opens up.
if the boss location is available, then the skull's eyes get
fire particles that light up and maybe smoke, signalling the
boss is ready to fight.
when link defeats a boss, the boss skull crumbles on the map.
the shadowo king's shadows are animated as well.
among other things...







House Design Guidelines

*we are no longer designing large houses*
this is because they look bad. the game handles
them fine, but it's not zelda-esque.

*we are no longer designing houses with backdoors*
again, the game can handle it fine, it just
doesn't make any sense for a small house to have
a back door. however, we may create a house where
the ONLY entrance is a backdoor - backdoors are
generally hidden until hero overlaps a roof tile.
so it would be a tiny puzzle.
