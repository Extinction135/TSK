brandy
captain of ship, her story.


link
has his boat destroyed by dark storms while at sea. wakes up in the water,
near brandy's boat. swims to the boat, talks to brandy, beginning story.
can't exit this first area until talking with brandy, setting story up.


the shadow king
the badguy, a mysterious shadow who created the islands and controls the
shadow realm or shadow world (which is essentially the darkworld, but only
for his shadow dungeon).


the blobs
captured prisoners of the shadow king. magic transformed them into blobs,
not quite existing in the light world and not quite existing in the shadow world,
somewhere in between. blobs are used to enforce TSK's bidding, as they have 
no physical free will of their own but can speak their mind freely. this leads
to situations where blobs frequently do things against their will and complain
about doing the task, allowing link to talk with them and get some comedic relief.
blobs also can't feel pain.
