Ship's Captain Brandy
-daughter of a sailor who became a ship captain.
-used to tell her stories of the sea as a child.
-one day he left and didn't come back, instead
his crew delivered his ship to her as per his will.
-she inherited the ship from her father, who taught
he how to sail and fix the ship. she set out on a
voyage to find her father, or at least learn about
what happened to him..
*brandy's braided locket of silver from far away
contains a small map to a secret island. lol.
*brandy knows how to fix and pilot the ship, but
she can't defend herself. she needs an enforcer.
*also, the musical reference is naisu.
it's a girl captain, who needs someone to defend her
ship that her father left her when he passed away.
it's the only thing she knows him by. her name is
brandy, and her father was a sailor.
she could feel the sea storm and rise in his eyes 
and stories. she used to listen to him tell tales 
of his voyages when she was young. he was lost at
sea, but his crew returned his ship to her as his
will commanded. the ship is named brandy too.
*this leaves an opening to a story looking for
Brandy's father/revenge, who was lost at sea...
