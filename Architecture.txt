Dungeon Run's architecture is based on MVC

	objects are represented as structures
	structures are passed to functions (that modify the structures state)
	functions are grouped into scopes (classes)
	structures are passed to functions by managers
	managers are coupled to the game + other managers
	data, functionality, and connectivity are seperated

	for example, a function whould never call a function outside of the function's group
	this would be done by a manager, which would call a sequence of functions

	to manage game state, DR uses screens and a screenManager
	dungeon screen
	pause screen
	navigation screen
	shop screen
	score screen
	title screen
	options screen
