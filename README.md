## Contributing 
+ Development is very active and messy right now.  
+ This is a passion project of mine, I'm not doing this for money.  
+ Please, please, please help me keep this quiet until it's done (version 1.0).  
+ If too many people notice this, it's likely Nintendo will notice this as well.   
+ And Nintendo has a habit of sending Cease & Desist letters to fan games...
