Magic Mirror
- returns link to dungeon entrance.
- plays warp sound fx
this should be done in conjunction with the upgraded level
screen opening / closing animation:
(4 black squares collapsing or opening on link)













because the blob boss has a cast sprite, he should be able to cast
revive upon his dead blob spawn randomly. this makes the boss fight
that much harder.

boss should 'stomp' dash, which creates an explosion where he lands.
we should have more frames of animation for this too.

boss blob's hit animation should be longer as well.
boss blob's death animation should be gory and long.
the final blob boss death sprite should have his guts hanging out.

blob's attack is to create a blob actor at it's location
this is done randomly






X becomes dodge underwater when link is in water.
this removes use of weapons while in water, but some
items can be used, like magic, where link has a reward state.

when hero dies in water, he sinks undewater..







*add a signpost outside the dungeon entrance that says "forest dungeon - caution!"
we could stuff this into the interaction comp as a string.
if obj's compInt string isn't null, pop dialog displaying obj as speaker.




we should have multiple rooms, each representing a floor, with an obj that transfers
hero between floors. this is  easiest, ad we can have as many floors as needed per room.
plus these rooms form a set, so we can build puzzles across floors, using an int or byte to 
track the room's floor level (basement, ground, 1st, etc...). plus pits can just drop hero to
a lower floor/room, unless it's the lowest floor which the spawns hero back at last door.







we can model height of objects with feet byte.
then we can check feet byte to see if projectile can fly over it.
smaller projectiles, like arrows, can fly over anything small. fireballs
need more space, etc... switches become 0 feet tall. levers 4 feet.
we move the interaction of objects into a realm that is familiar: height.
walls are 10 feet. then it makes sense.





use a shovel on ground, ground becomes trench obj.
every 30 frames, water tiles check to see if they touch a trech obj.
if they do, trench becomes water tile. this allows hero to dig trenches
and fill them with water. cascade effect: low water, med water, deep water
objs act the same way, high to med to low to trench. this causes the water
to visually 'rise' up over a period of 2 seconds.




Ratings Ticket
this is a menuItem that the player can select from the inventory screen
the info widget displays the current savedata's rating (k/d)
this is first 'story item'.

Create colliseum NPC vendor.
this is where Link can get his rating item from.
it's free, and displays his K/D from the info screen.
in later colliseum quests, K/D may be a requirement to enter some tournaments.





what if enemies only fell into pits if they were in a hit state?
this would prevent them from falling in unless hero had pushed them off.
if enemy isn't in hit state, then push them the opposite direction.
hero can still fall off as nomal tho.






slow finish / build becuase we call cleanRoom() twice, which is dumb af





















lightworld forest entrance should be opening in trees
dark world should be horrific tree trunk thing we have rn.






Darkworld hand enemy:
this is the dungeon hand enemy from the dark world forest dungeon.
drop randomly from the top of the screen, or burrows from underneath the ground.
RAPIDLY runs around (not attacking player), then burrows / hides. Has super
creepy sounds, only meant to creep out the player.






Things that "spread" like water or fire
this can be done by temporarily expanding the obj's collision rec, then doing
the interaction check, then reverting the collision rec back to proper size.
if water tile overlaps trench, trench becomes water tile.
if ground fire overlaps grass, grass burns and becomes ground fire.
this interaction spread needs to be limited to the middle or beginning
of the object's or projectile's lifetime, so it doesn't spread too fast or slow.
we can control how fast it spread by what frame this happens on.
fire spreads slower, later interaction.
water spreads faster, earlier interaction.
*the ground around water tiles should be coastline tiles, so the transition
can happen properly - coastline tiles create wet feet sprite*






explosions should push bomb projectiles.
it would be so easy, and it would make bomb projectiles feel alive!
placing bombs next to one another would be unpredictable past 2-3 interactions










- can we 'reboot' in 1920x1080? can we have player input to set the size?
on Dx, this is easy. on UWP, this is not so easy, but also doesn't matter terribly.
this could be modeled as an enum value in flags: if(Flags.platform == Platform.DirectX)
then we could handle rebooting the game into 1920x1080, or:
1. set window size to match monitor display resolution, enable fullscreen
2. scale game up x2, x3, x4, etc.. based on height + width available
3. center the game's renderFrame / target to the window
4. draw the game frame centered with black bars around it

- this should make the game display as large as possible while still pixel
perfect on all monitors / tvs / displays. 
***can we do this from an options menu?***







- implement picking up, carrying, throwing bushes, pots, skulls
hero throws obj upon leaving room, falling into pit, getting hit, etc..

*** we could have a massive tree trunk without a top for the entrance ***
the trunk would just keep going all the way up to the top of the sprite sheet,
and we'd place the dungeon entrance near the top of the level, always.
this way, it appears like it's much bigger in game, and we can surround it
with various smaller trees to increase it's relative size.
plus, this tree looks like it belongs in the dark world. rt.




i want to put portals / entrances in their own widget, because they have
various sizes, and we only need to display them occasionally, unlike shared objs
which we display more often, plus we're just wasting widget objs by covering
them up with the dungeon entrance obj...




in editor, when we select an object, we are assuming that obj is 16x16
instead we should be centering the obj to the cursor based on the sprites framesize




add signpost obj that hero can read to dungeon entrance level discussing dungeon.





initially when the boomerang hits an obj, we could alter its lifetime
to where it wouldn't collide with the immediate objs for a few frames,
giving it a chance to escape and not create tons of collision/attention particles.


HANDLE AUTOSAVE
we *do* need to handle autoSave somehow, because it does contain 
the last game - we can simply add it to the load screen as another option.













add animated floating clouds to the overworld screen




*we could also add a frame counter right next to button input, showing fps





quad black rectangle transitions
4 black rectangles converge onto link, simulating Lttp's circular black transition
between levels, etc.. 
this will replace the level screen's overlay fading in/out






SPIKEBLOCK++
what about a spike block that rotate right or left every 100 frames?
this would cause it to rotate around something, unlike any other spike block seen before... harumph!
this is simply a spikeblock sprite with new obj enum, as a projectile or roomObj,
it's behavior simply counts up to 100 then switches it's compMove direction thru a series
either right or left. thats it. hahahahahaa




dripping/shiny particles randomly on the trunk.




when hero interacts with the dungeon entrance, a mysterious stranger
asks them if they choose to enter the dungeon *name*.. this is actually
zelda, and she's tracking how many times link has entered this dungeon, 
and how many times he's beaten it. this affects zelda's 'judgements' later on.





freeze an enemy, sprinkle magic powder on them, smash with a hammer = full magic pot




Picking Up Objects++
picking up a pot puts hero into a carry state, but leaves the roomObj drawing on the sreen, but nonblocking
hero doesn't display anything over his head
setting the obj down doesn't move the roomObj, but instead makes it blocking again.
we need to be altering ROOMOBJECTS only, we dont need to abstract it into a thrown / carrying obj
if hero collides with a door, simply destroy the carrying obj reference

all related to picking up/carrying/throwing/pushing/pulling
{

*currently the obj hero picks up doesn't appear over his head
the obj stays in it's picked up spot

	hero should be able to pickup and throw enemy corpses
	which means we need to abstract the carrying obj into something that could ref an obj or actor
	or we have both, one for objs and one for actors

	what if the obj the hero picks up simply assumes the target obj's texture and frame, etc..?
	this would work for actors as well, which sets the ground work for allowing the hero to pickup 
	blob corpses and use them in some interesting way... like dropping them on a switch!
	we already do this with pots essentially, but we need to abstract the carrying/throwing solution
	to be more generalized and handle roomObjs, actors, or whatever we throw at it in the future..

	Dragging/Pushing/Pulling

	hero should be able to 'grab' objects
	if the object is draggable, then hero should be able to push and pull on it
	this 'grabbing' state should last until player releases the A button
	objects should inherit the movement of hero, 
	and check collisions with all roomObjs, entities, & actors (expensive)
	if a draggable object would collide, it doesn't move
	this would have to be done per axis too, so we could drag along walls

	in order to accomplish these two things, we will need to be able to compare a gameobj against the roomObjs
	this starts with a collision check, then an interaction upon an overlap
	we would call this from dragging / pushing / pulling, and conveyor belt checks
	
	when we throw an object, should we create an entity?
	and should this entity be a projectile with a caster?
	so the game would know who threw the object, if we had effects later
	for example, lifesteal or something else that targets the caster upon obj collision.
}






Implement Dynamic Shadows System

an object pool for shadows would be great
objects / actors could have a field for a shadow sprite reference
then we could store a shadow offset, which allows us to fake depth on the Z axis
if we keep the shadow in one place, while raising the obj/act, then we get depth off the ground
this also sets the stage for flying obj/actors, as they would have changing shadow positions.
this also means we need to 'unbake' the shadows from ALL objects and actors.



























Special Sword Attack
should be able to charge up attack and spin just like Lttp.





Grass Interactions++
when hero moves thru tall grass, part of his feet should be obscured,
just like Lttp. this is some kind of small animated grass thing
and it only animates when the hero is moving. if he isn't moving,
then the foot grass cover shouldnt animate at all.
** this is a particle? projectile? either way, it's not on the
entities sheet - it's on the level sheet, because it needs to match
the color of the grass that it's covering.













Improve GameObj Naming Conventions
we should shorten the dungeon_ prefix for gameObj to dun_.
and world_ to wor_ .
this will help those items better fit into the objTools widget
plus, this shortens the overall size of the roomData xml by removing chars.













ENUM FIELDS - OH MY GOD, IF THIS WORKS...
masterwork: the bitFields used in cursedCastle were FASSSST.
and we recently learned that booleans / bits are the same cost in
ram gets/sets as ints, which we can abstract into enums.
so instead of bitFields, create enumFields.
they'll be just as fast, and you can model each tile as
many different ways as you want to, for water / islands / rooms
anything.. this could actually make procedurally creating rooms
ALOT faster, because we could build the room up using two enumField
lists - one for the doors / walls, and one for the interior objs (xml objs).
we wouldn't need to do collision checking between objects, because
we'd be setting the tiles by value, and not by position (conceptually).
so, maybe we spend some time investigating enumFields...







BIG OPTIMIZATION
if we don't draw the floor tiles, the draw loop is much faster
so, we could standardize the room sizes, then create a floor sprite
then instead of drawing 200 floor sprites, we just draw 1 larger floor sprite








Lttp Stuff we're missing:

Keys!!!
**we could have 'keys' in the game, which would be temporary for the room only
the doors would shut and convert to locked versions, or only some of them would.
inside the room is a chest that contains a key. hero picks up the key, unlocks 
a door, key is used, continues on. the room resets, works the same later on.
the key would be displayed in the inventory screen as a brittle rusty key.
and when it's used, the key breaks. the flavor text says that the key will
likely break after one use.

we could lock one door randomly, or we could lock ALL THE DOORS, and then 
force the player to choose which door they want to unlock.




PULLABLE LEVERS
these are built into the wall and open shut doors, just like a switch
these must be pulled for a bit tho, and there are decoy levers that will
spawn snakes or explode..

these large levers should be reserved for dungeon changes,
like flooding the dungeon, etc.. which we could model simply 
with a boolean, which would then add shallow water to all rooms,
and change pits to deep water, making some areas PASSABLE! yes.
this is how we can procedurally shut off areas of the dungeon. ah, perfect.

example, the hub room could have a big lever that floods the dungeon
and the hero must pull the lever to flood the key room, because that
key room has a chest surrounded by pits, which is totally inaccessible.
we could also put the big lever in some random roomm, or in its own
special room, which would be present in dungeons that can undergo
structural changes (like flooding)... hmm...










DUNGEON NAMES
dungeons should have names.
the dungeon name should be displayed on the map.
dungeon names could be randomly generated from a list.




LINK FLOATING
a specific loadout should allow link to float + move, without dashing tho.
something that makes him light as a feather (armor/equip) plus the repaired
pegasus boots. note: when the pegasus boots are repaired, there is no immediate
benefit as dashing works the same before and after. it's just partA of this combo.
partB is getting the equip/armor.





UNDERWORLD DUNGEONS
there should be dungeons where the spawn room doens't contain the exit.
rather a critical path is built to the exit room, which contains a ladder
that leads up. climbing this ladder exits the hero to the overworld screen.
finding this exit is the primary objective of this dungeon type, which a
player might fall into from an overworld level. along the critical path to
the exit, the player could run into: minibosses, loot, secret rooms, branching
paths, portals, etc...

these underworld dungeons come from overworld level objects, like pits, bombable
doors, pipes, etc...








BUILDING DESTRUCTION
normal buildings become the damaged versions upon explosions.
damaged buildings becomes debris, rubble, and rarely loot upon explosions or attacks.
damaged buildings or objs can be destroyed with weapons.






SWIMMING
this only happens upon collision with water objs. links default state is standing idle.
upon collision with water obj, link switches to swimming state.
from here, player can press B to 'dash' in the water, and press A to 'dive'.
diving is useful if there is something in the water, noted by a darker color sprite.
but that sprite is just ambiguous, and until the hero dives down and collects whatever
it is, the player wont get the reward. and we *should* have a reward state for link.
dungeons can have deep water (sinks) and shallow water (just has wading fx)
and we can build puzzles around this, because it's impossible to tell them apart
but we should be able to tell them apart, with some kind of shallow water lighter color difference
this is important to do now, because it affects the layout of the dungeon sheet





DIRT PATHING
by default, the background color is a grass color. to that,
we add dirt paths, animated grass objects scattered throughout, etc...







BLOB BOTTLING
i like the idea of bottling blobs, but not turning link into one.
instead link should bottle a blob and bring it to an npc for inspection.
this inspection then opens the dialog with the blob who explains the sidequest.





we've also complicated the piss out of dialog screen with booleans, simply because we
are forcing it into the post-title screen load dialog, where we transition from dialog
to overworld. nowhere else do we do this. plus, we aren't planning to do anything else
like that, so consider splitting that functionality out of dialog screen, and instead
handling that at the end of LSN screen - since that's the only place it can be called from.
we can handle it once here, and vastly simplify the dialog screen - so we can complicate
it much later with story element stuff.





PLATFORMS + BUILDING
i like the idea of building platforms to cross pits or areas of insta-death.
but, unlike other games we're gonna use magic here to build platforms, and we're
gonna loop this minecraft/fortnite idea back to LttP by using the cane. in lttp,
we could build platforms using the cane, but only in specific places.
what if link could build a platform anywhere he was, the direction he was facing,
right in front of him where he could step right onto it (aligned to 16px grid).
these platforms would be permanent until the life of the room too, and cost 1 magic.









WALL TORCHES
if we seperate the wall torch off the wall bkg sprite, then we can reuse
it indoors in world rooms, or outside on buildings. but, we need to update
the door decoration algorithm to add torches, instead of replacing the wall
with a wall torch, which acts simply as a wall.



INCREASE MAGIC
we do need a way to increase our total magic, tho.
just like hearts, this item should be sold be the items vendor.








BOMBABLE WALLS++
add falling debris when straight walls are cracked by explosions.
this is probably going to need to be a larger debris particle commit / system
because the particles are going to be on the dungeon sheet, and we'll need
to fake gravity and ground bouncing / friction collisions...









Bushes++

when we hit a bush, we should create bush leaf debris.
this leaf debris is pushed the direction of the hit on the bush,
so it inherits the inertia of the hit, 

first, the initial BIG push in the hit direction happens
then a small random directional push is applied to vary the leaf trajectories.

BUT this means we need to have moving particles.. AND WE DO!
this means we can push particles, giving them inertia.
this would be very nice.









INT / COLL WIDGET
create interaction / collision info widget, which displays that data
instead of stuffing it into the world ui... ooof!
we can link f3 to drawing the interaction / collision info widget









Boomerangs++

boomerang sounds are totally wrong, clinks off a bush?
triggers a bush? no. fix boomerang soundfx.





Arrows++
when arrow collides with a blocking obj, 
set arrow's speed to 0, increase it's friction slightly.
it should 'sink' into a final position, inside the wall,
where it will 'live' until frame 255, then be removed.
this ONLY works on blocking objects without any magnitude.
IF THE OBJ DOES HAVE A MAGNITUDE, 
then we just kill the arrow upon collision.
otherwise the obj would move, and the arrow wouldn't travel with it.
and that would look WRONG.





Slippery Slope!
*if we slide a bomb across ice, then onto grass,
the bomb keeps sliding as if it were on ice. it's a pro.
so maybe we aren't resetting the friction prior
to checking projectile interactions with roomObjs?








Doors -> Doors & Portals

we need a cheat code to convert all doors to open doors.
this would bypass traps, boss door, open all hidden doors, etc...
but, this would also convert any exits or portals, unless we
separated the idea of doorObjs to be doorObjs and portalObjs,
where a door links two rooms, but a portal exits level.
this would be a new kind of obj.group... 






BURNMARKS
groundfires should leave burn mark.
explosions should leave burn mark..

EXPLOSIONS++
add 'burn' mark particle for explosions
should last for 255 frames, mark the ground dark, then fade away.
sprite.alpha = (float)obj.lifeCount * 3  //when this drops below 50frames, it will fade out
*this can be reversed if life is counting up instead..
if life > 250, alpha = 100 - (life - 250) * 2;










Explosion Surfing (Bomb Jumping)

if an actor is hit, simply put them into a flying state.
this will cause the actor to be able to fly across pits for a moment,
but when the hit state ends, if they overlap the pit, they
will be pulled in. but, this does allow a type of bomb jumping,
or rather "explosion surfing". which sounds so much better.

we could even put the actor into a 2nd type of hit state,
a staggered state, which would hold the actor in the hit state for
longer, allowing them to fly for longer, allowing them to cross
single tile pits safely - and only an explosion would be able
to set an actor into this 2nd hit staggered hit state.

which, staggered seems like a poor name for this state.
likely should be something like ExplosiveThrow, 
so we know the actor is being thrown by an explosion.

we can implement this now and ensure that bomb jumping is not
only preserved, but supported officially in this game, and is
known as explosion surfing, because you can also use fireballs
to do these type of explosive throwing tricks.















PROPERTY, BANK ACCOUNTS, + THE ECONOMY

so, the hero can only have 99 rupees on his character.
however, he can open an account that allows him to store up to 999,999 rupees,
if he pays 99 rupees at a specific location talking to a specific person.
then throughout the game, the hero can withdraw or deposit money thru a bank
representative, which are characters scattered around most vendor based levels.
this allows the player to store more money, and get access to it when needed, 
while still having to pick and choose what to buy and carry with them.
*later on, when a business is for sale, the hero must have a bank account to 
purchase the business or property, because that's how the deal is handled thru.
without a bank account, the hero wouldn't be able to possess enough money to purchase
any business or property over 99 rupees...




















REWARDS AS PROJECTILES (?)
we *COULD* track overhead rewards to hero if we model them as projectiles instead of particles.
that way hero doesn't have to stateLock into a reward unless it's for a cast or use
alternatively, we could just slowly allow the reward particle to rise up, then dissappear.





OVERWORLD SCREEN MAP++
add tiny smoke particles coming out of some houses
add 'floating' animation to ship (should bob up and down)
this means it needs to be a sprite in the main sheet
make castlel ruins look more 'ruiny'




MAGNETIC ISLAND
this is a set of levels where a Push() is applied to EVERyTHING each frame.
the direction could be magnetic north, or it could be changeable by object or season.





WIND + WIND MAGIC
this applies a max force Push() to everything on screen except hero, based on
the direction hero is facing. this wind magic can be re-used in game as wind, if
we turn the force down to something more manageable, play wind sound fx, and blow
leaves / dust when it happens..




PUSHWAND + LIGHTWAVE PROJECTILE

the flame throwers on the ground shouldn't shoot fireballs
they should shoot those light wave things, which dont deal damage to what they hit!
they actually only push what they hit, and they dont die upon a collision
they will continue to push whatever they collide with until they die from age
this means we need a new type of projectile, which is exciting

and we can use this wave as the projectile created from the wand!
we can call it the push wand, which would allow us to create a whole new type of puzzle
where we can use the push wand to move objects to solve rooms!!!





FULL SCREEN AOE MAGIC SPELLS
it's really simple to do this, just create explosions around the hero,
or play a bunch of random explosion sprites everywhere, then damage all
active enemies like so:

for (i = 1; i < Pool.actorCount; i++) //skip actorPool[0] (hero)
{
	if (Pool.actorPool[i].active) //deal 1 point of damage to all active actors
	{ Functions_Battle.Damage(Pool.actorPool[i], 1, 0.0f, Functions_Direction.GetRandomDirection()); }
}

either actually create projectiles to kill enemies, or fake it with particles
it just depends on the effect and magic behavior




Projectiles++
WanderingFire 
this is just like spikeblock except the obj.direction is chosen randomly upon collision
the direction cannot be the current direction however, and can only be cardinal	
should be able to place wandering fire using tools widget



Improve / Beautify Feedback Info
we need to move the left handed update collision interaction draw times
into it's own widget, which is drawn on the right side, and make it linked
to a boolean which draws it, which is then linked to the cheats menu as a
draw dev info cheat.



MAGIC POWDER (?)
**if you sprinkle magic powder on a dead enemy, he comes back to life at 100% hp
but, he's still your enemy, so i don't know how useful it is practically...




Boat
takes hero to different islands
if hero is blob, then secret blob islands become available (like blob home island)


Rage Potion
for 255 frames hero cant take any damage, doubles damage with weapon in hand





OBJECTS:

Destroyed Debris object
the dungeon statue should become the destroyed version upon destruction.
any object that can be destroyed should become this object.
this object should look like a pile of rocks. can be pushed.

Circling Stars
just like Lttp, the circling stars turns hero into an enemy actor type
except, it's not on a timer. hero becomes enemy actor type until Circling stars collides with hero again.
this is a check: if hero.type != hero, become enemy, else become hero.

BUG - PITS
if an actor overlaps two pits at the exact same time
they can be pulled into each pit, resulting in a cancelled out pull
leaving actor hovering over pits, which is bad
*which could easily be fixed by using a weaker pull on the left for all pits
*the actor would slowly be pulled into the right pit, 
*then quickly pulled once they dont collide with left pit any more




for the ice dungeon, procedurally add ice tiles to each room
if ice tile overlaps with a pit / bridge / floor spikes / cracked floor, remove it
this can be done in the cleanup of room
and we'll probably need to expand the max size of roomObjs



implement a level 2 magic spell
this would deal 1 damage to everything on screen
and play explosions randomly inside the room
should be named bombos, sold by magic dealer



WorldUI++
when the hero's health changes, the worldUI should animate hearts individually
if the hero gains 5 health, each heart should scale up, then animate down
once that heart's scale reaches 1.0, then the next heart can animate
this sequential scaling should happen anytime hero's health changes






Boss dialog + Boss phases
initially the boss should popup a dialog mocking player
after boss hits half health, another dialog should popup
this one talks about boss changing tactics
"you're better than i expected"
in the 2nd phase, the boss moves AWAY from the hero
so its harder for the hero to hit the boss
in first phase, the boss just randomly moves around














title widget functionality ++
	audio/input/video/game ctrls - creates appropriate screen

audio ctrls screen
	sfx volume
	music volume
	
input ctrls screen
	bvisual representation of button controls
	
video ctrls screen
	full screen or windowed?
	
game ctrls screen
	how camera moves - follow hero or center to current room? 
	we only need to flip Flags.CameraTracksHero boolean
	
	
if we make a PlayerData.loaded instance of SaveData,
and then load the stream data from Functions_Backend
into that Data.loaded instance, then we would have a restore point
kind of system, plus we could simplify both Dx and UWP
backend functions to simply load their streams into data.loaded.
right now, they're setting the game data for each of the 3 files,
which really shouldn't be a responsibility of the backend functions.
	
	
	
Handling corrupt game files & first run setup - part 2

if a saved game file has correct XML headers, then game will load it
any fields that match to saveData's fields will then be loaded
theoretically, we could load an XML file that has no correct fields,
and the game would never know.. 
this makes it impossible to check if the loaded data is corrupt or accurate.
only XML with malformed opening header tags will fail to load.

we need a way to check that the loaded xml is actually a game file

create a saveData instance, set all it's fields to null
then load the saveFile into the null saveData
then check each field of the saveData to see if it's not null
if any field is null, then the loaded saveFile was corrupted
however, we can probably extract some data from the corrupt file 
so we could prompt the user with a dialog that asks 'load uncorrupted data?'
'the file i loaded is corrupt. should i try to recover it?'	









	
	
	
	


where do we display the kill ratio?
this is displayed in a stats widget somewhere that hasn't been designed yet
equation for determining skill rating in percentage.
this is: total enemies killed / damage taken
ex: 10/1 = 10.   245/73 = 3.35.


we could simplify bumper interactions if we could just say
if (obj.compCollision.Interacts_With_Bumper), then we bounce the obj.
instead we're doing this inside of the type check, which is duplicating
alot of code calling BounceOffBumper(), then passing the obj.





































*************************************************************************
MAYBES (these may/not be possible?)






DungeonDesign - Taking it Further
there should be 'architectural puzzles', where the dungeon changes in some way
this could be raising/lowering water levels
moving forward/backwards in time
destroying parts of the dungeon/rooms
using switches to alter the paths thru rooms, or alter the nature of rooms
however this is done needs to exist ontop of the already built concept of
critical paths, where we procedurally build smaller crit paths to complete
the overall dungeon.




BITE from all the other awesome games you love:
	theres so much to do and explore
	we need more to do and explore
	should be able to have a pet, like a dog
	should be able to speak with more people/npcs
	should be able to manage traders, adventurers, etc.. (blackflag?)
	should be able to craft advanced items, using special parts + gold
	
	
	
	

Make the AI system Behavior based, where a Behavior is an enumerator

actor.behaviors = new List<Behaviors> { Behavior.Aggressive, Behavior.Curious, Behavior.Destructive }
Behavior.Aggressive (actor will pursue hero without regard for safety)
Behavior.Attacks (actor will attack hero, if hero is close enough)
Behavior.Curious (actor will randomly explore the area around them)
Behavior.Destructive (actor will attack any destructible object it comes across)
Behavior.SpawnsMobs (actor can spawn other actors, based on actor.type)
Behavior.ThrowsPots (actor will pickup and throw object it comes across at hero)

an enumerator, and a list in the actor class.
then we modify the AI method to work based on behaviors.
if actor.behavior[i] == 
- aggressive, move actor towards hero, if hero is visible
- attacks, attack hero if hero is close enough
- curious, randomly move actor
- destructive, attack destructible objects nearby
- spawnsMobs, randomly spawn mobs based on the actor.type
- throwsPots, picks up nearby pots, carrys them, and throws them at hero if hero is visible
