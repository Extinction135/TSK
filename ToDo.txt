1.0 - official release



Today:









Version 0.76 Media

note: soak tested at title screen for about 
100 mins prior to recording with OBS at 60fps. 

recorded multiple playthroughs.
recorded several gifs.
edited together into a v076 release gif.

added recorded gifs to /gifs/ folder in repo.
modified VERSIONS.md to better present timeline
of development in gifs.

remade readme to only load 1 gif, which is only
5mb and a much better presentation of the game.













































notes:

only spawn 1 floating eye in forest dungeon rooms.

if a room with a switch in it has been solved, (visited)
then remove the floor switch obj post room build.

if player has the map, dont spawn the miniboss.






































0.77 - Islands in RAM

level data files cant be too BIG.

colliseum should exist on it's own.
dungeon entrances can exist on their own too.
brandys boat level can exist on its own too.
(boat level always has coastline + pier, or anchored at sea).

an overworld is then composed of about 10 levels.
because that's the max we can fit into a single .cs class in vs (lol).
these levels can link to dungeons, no problemo.
dungeon rooms can be split into col, row, square, key, and TheRest.
this way we dont run into this problem MUCH later in development,
when we start adding more and more roomData



biomes?






House Design Guidelines

*we are no longer designing large houses*
this is because they look bad. the game handles
them fine, but it's not zelda-esque.

*we are no longer designing houses with backdoors*
again, the game can handle it fine, it just
doesn't make any sense for a small house to have
a back door. however, we may create a house where
the ONLY entrance is a backdoor - backdoors are
generally hidden until hero overlaps a roof tile.
so it would be a tiny puzzle.








Overworld++

diversify the town levels.
we need two town levels on left.
more npcs on farm level south (plus chicken pen + posts).
we need a blank level on right, where the fire is.
we need a town level on right with some npcs there too.

this adds many locations to the primary overworld,
spreading out the NPCs and making the levels a bit simpler.






Houses in Water

can we build a house over water tiles? 
sure, why not? this means we can build an
entire town in the ocean...

do a mockup of this in a town by the water.

Swim Instructor NPC - should be near house in water.

we need a swim instructor NPC that stands in front of a large pond.
has dialog like:

do you know how to swim? i'm sure you do.
just hop in the water.

press B while moving to swim faster.
press X to dive underwater for a bit.

while underwater, enemies can't see you,
but you swim slower. 

try picking up objects and carrying them
into the water as well. have fun!

make the pond an actual pool-like arrangement.










Levels++

Left Towns
add a 2nd town level on the left of the map, below left town.
add a 3rd town level on the left of the colliseum connector.
this makes 3 towns on the left.

right town level

campground level








improve the swamp entrance level.
lock the water tiles and add a bunch of swamp objects around everywhere



when water spreads to other tiles, it shouldn't play
the water splash soundfx, this takes waaay too long.
it should play the water walk sfx, or we should shorten
the water splash sound fx dramatically. either or.
or we should create a water spreading soundfx,
then use the splash fx shortened. i dunno.









Burning Bushes ++

burning bushes dont transfer fire south to other bushes.
this can be fixed by touching the expanding hitbox in ai functions.
it should expand further south in it's vertical spread check.



Grass++

cut grass should grow into tall grass if near coastlines,
or filled ditches. 






dungeon map should display legend if hero has visited that
room. this makes it easier to track where special rooms are,
once the dungeon has been explored.

add dungeon vendors to dungeon systems. these vendors exist
in some rooms randomly (added in editor). should have to solve
a puzzle to get to them too. they sell special items and enemy
items. they can be marked with a V on the dungeon map.







Exits++
we should be able to make exits specific to dungeons as
well. they should visually introduce the dungeon, as well
as any basic mechanics: for example the swamp exit should
transtion from land to water, from the exit door obj. this
symbolizes that this dungeon uses alot of water tiles.






forest level redesign -
a horizontal set of trees block the dungeon entrance.
the entrance is surrounded by indestructible objs.
player HAS TO BURN down the trees to get access to dungeon.
this teaches player objs can be destroyed.
bonus: grass under the trees should act as a fuse for a
massive forest fire across the whole level. kinda like it
does now, but better.


Mountain Sprites
add black pixels to the corners of the mountain wall sprites.
this will make the rooms appear rounded, which further visually
separates them. 




Colliseum Entrance Obj++
the colliseum entrance obj should just be a wide black entrance,
like the center sprite. we dupe that for a total of 3, so we have
a massive entrance. then put those skull pillars on the side. why?
to match the entrance/exit sizes between the colliseum levels.
the exit from the interior is pretty wide, so the entrance
should be wide as well.





it would be nice to show the currently selected objects
important parameters, like moveable, grounded, etc..
we could put this info next to the object in the objTools
widget, if we extende the widget.


footholds were pushed off the mountain wall.
i assume a frame of interaction happened prior to
the roomObj types being updated. 
*when we reset the pool, stopMovement() on all objs.









Release version 0.76
test install on windows10 via Dx.
test install/run on xbox one via UWP.
print media for 0.76 (main gif, playthru video).
update readme with links.





























really important things that i should really fix i think?



Polish + Fixes

explosions should push roomObjects that they touch.
that are moveable. that dont get destroyed?
are explosions pushing objects?


rats and crabs should "bite", but turtles dont.
all types can be picked up and carried, but rats
and crabs will eventually bite link, causing link
to throw the creature and take 1 damage.






Actor Refs

a projectile's caster should be an actor reference.
if a projectile's caster is null, then it should have no behavior.
this is because some gameobjects cast projectiles,
but in that case the projectile wouldn't have any behavior
related to the caster.

this simplifies the current system for handling projectiles,
which uses the moveComponent. using this moveComp, projectile.update
attempts to prevent projectiles from ovrelapping with their casters,
but this is based on the compMove and not the hitBox, which is
actually the target of importance. we need to have access to
the entire actor object, not just it's compMove! we need to
touch the actor's hitBox from projectile.update, and we can't currently.
once we do this, we can check and align projectiles to the actor's
hitBox, and then larger enemies can have larger hitboxes while also
being able to cast projectiles...
plus, projectiles could properly implement their behaviors - by
tracking the actor's hitbox instead of their newPosition..

Improve Projectile.Spawn()

*miniboss cant shoot fireballs south - why?
?= pro.spawn() assumes that the actor's collRec is 16x16 - it shouldn't.
this means only 16x16 actors can safely shoot fireballs without damaging
themselves, which is some valve level stupid. this method should take
the actor as a parameter, and then we should base the offsets FOR ALL
PROJECTILES off of the actor's collision rec width and height. this
would allow larger actors, like bosses, to SHOOT FIREBALLS. geez.

Special Attacks / Boss "USE"
bigeye uses the shut + bloodshot frames for his special.
bigeye: spawns A TON of exploding seekers while in his special.
