Ground Fire Spell

We need this to test ground fires, which are basic
to the game world, so create ground fire spell.

added fire spell menuitem. added ground fire spell.
fires can now be cast in the facing direction of the
caster, allowing me to exactly test fires in game.


Debug Displays++

increase size of debug displays for pool counter,
colls + ints too. done.

















Bombos Tuning (max interaction test)

reduce the chance of ground fires spawning rising
smoke particles. this reduces pressure on the particle
pool during bombos.

reduce the lifetime of explosions + ground fires,
this helps to keep bombo's branch quick.

randomly choose to create an explosion at that spawn
pos, during bombos active phase.

dont spawn explosions along top of screen, or bottom
of screen. dont spawn offscreen left or right. this
reduces the total number spawned each frame.

increase the time between explosion 'line' spawns.
we could even trigger bombos each frame, going down
the line sequentially instead of all at once. we
could then add a timer to that sequential spawn,
allowing the pools to process the explosions across
frames instead of all at once.

projectile_explosion_maybeFire - is a pro just like
explosion that spawns a fire PARTICLE or PROJECTILE
randomly 50/50 split. this varies how many ground
fires bombos leaves behind, while also creating a 
unique pattern of fire behind the explosions.























Add Wind
	wind vs ints
	wind vs acts
	wind vs pros

	

	
	
	
	
Pool:
wind - pushes: actors, pros, ints, pickups

wind objs are just projectiles, but they exist in their
own pool - which is done to reduce the number of interaction
checks wind does and simplify it's implementation. wind
interacts (pushes) everything, based on the wind projectiles
speed or magnitude value. this is acts, pros, ints.

wind should interact with everything last, prior to movement,
to give wind the final say over movement and magnitude.



	
	
	
	


WIND! objects

wind projectiles push actors and roomObjs (and other projectiles?)
hold up! wind projectiles should be in their own pool, so we can
check them against the main projectile pool, allowing wind to push
projectiles, making wind the only defense against projectiles - useful!

levels have wind direction, wind intensity, wind birth.
this is fed into routines that randomly spawn wind pros on screen
in level direction, with level intensity(magnitude), at level birth rate.

Spells - round 2

spell to cast gust of wind (max magnitude).
spell to cast gusts of wind away from the caster all directions.



Wind spells

*wind projectiles exist in their own pool, because they interact with
roomObjs, actors, AND projectiles - allowing wind to push EVERYTHING.
this allows wind to COUNTER projectiles. which make wind spells the most
powerful, but also limited because they dont do direct damage. so it 
takes intelligence and skill to use them.
gust: wind pro in casters direction.
repel: wind pros from casters center out, constantly across frames.
fly: pushes caster in facing direction each frame, in flying state.
mass move: pushes all objs, actors, and pros in room in given direction.
control wind: sets the level's wind direction, intensity, and frequency.
tornado: spawns a tornado roomObj. (fire, ice, explosive, electrical tornados too)...
****wind should work in water as well*****



















Moar Optimizations!

boat floor objs need to be actual floor objs.
when we add them, we should be adding them from
the floors pool. cut grass and small grass, and
dirt tiles can all be floor objects, reducing the
strain on interactive obj pool more. these floor
objects are not actually interactive either.
we don't use floor objs in field levels, and thats
a waste of a useful budget for displaying certain
types of game objects that fields def do need.
















we need a test level that contains all the dungeon
entrances. linked to shadow level pls. we should be
able to build the game and test it.






Indestructible Objs++

hero should have interaction rec with main exit object, taking
them outside the dungeon.




	
	

	
	
	
	
	
	

	
	
	









Levels++

add boat objects to the int widgets - barrels, etc.....

add boat objs to boat ind widgets

	
build ship at sea base level
complete level rebuilds
complete roomData rebuilds	














Bombos spawns explosions, which leave behind groundfire pros.
this is causing pro system overload. bombos explosions shouldn't
create groundfires. just those explosions tho - so they need to
be special or seperate from normal explosions.


Bombos++ (large scale destruction)

bombos has to use a different explosion
type that doesn't create ground fires - or we
create explosion particles across the frame and
any objs near spawn point get turned into debris.

the particle system is much larger and can handle
the massive scale better. this also keeps projectiles
available for any gameplay during an environmental
spell, which WILL happen in-game for sure.





Fire Interactions++

tables should burn, then collapse into debris.
same with all interior house objs, like beds, stoves,
etc...

flowers should become grass version 2, or whatvs.
not cut grass, but the one less than that, when they
are burned.











Explosive/Fire spells
Circle of Fire - creates groundfire around the caster in circle, across frames, continuously.
Fire Rain - red rain falls, creating ground fires where ever they touch (environmental fx).


Ice Spells

hail - large snowball objs fall, causing level 1 destruction,
creating icetiles where ball hitbox overlaps, mostly single ice tiles.
this is diff pattern than iceballs.
snowstorm - freezes all objects in level (frozen state), distrubuted
across frames, randomly freezing objs and placing icetiles
ice block wall - create wall of destructible ice blocks (only blocking, with ice
tiles underneath and around them).
ice block freeze all - freezes all actors with iceblocks that can be
frozen (non minibosses and bosses).



Electricity spells
ether - bolts from the sky (should have small clouds over them) (should
happen across frames too)
thunderstorm - clouds appear randomly, spawning bolts down
*levels should spawn clouds too - can 'rain' regrowing objects,
plus this adds depth. they can rain lightning, fire, ice, etc..
think of them as magic or projectile factories that interfere with
the player...

new ether
this just sequentially does the bolts, not all at once, and also
randomly spawns bolts around the caster (but not touching).
THERE SHOULD BE CLOUDS!







Quake Magic Medallion

how is this different than ether, in-game? ether kills
all, quake destroys everything that isn't flying. this
causes des level 2 to all objects and enemies who have
compMove.grounded set to false, except hero.
this simply shakes the camera for it's effect.

Summon spells

skeletons - actors that cannot be killed (self-rez from extended hit state).
summons 1, 4, or 16 or them.
bat summons are already done, more or less.

Comet Medallion

meteor/comet (single big / many small) falls from sky, smashing into ground,
leaving crater objects and explosions. this is the 4th medallion, meteor.

SpellBook++

need a widget / window that displays in the spell
screen that matches options widgets dimensions.
should simply contain text that explains what magic
is and how it's used. for example, WIND counters.








Ice Tile Melting++

fire melting ice is good, but it needs polish.
when we melt ice, we should create a wet spot particle,
which lasts for 200 or so frames, and helps to ease 
the ice tiles transition out of the world, since it
just dissappears right now.














BURN HOUSES

as in, have burned versions of each house obj that randomly
smoke and rarely collapse (like roofs randomly collapsing).
this should apply to a certain set of objects only.
consider making these objects in their own pool, because they
handle interactions and can be blocking / non-blocking.
indestructible objs ONLY BLOCK, and NEVER INTERACT.

all these house objs are on thier own sheet btw...









Fire Tornado
should be able to cast a fire tornado. this is obtained from fire tornado island,
by solving the puzzle and defeating the fire tornado destroying the land. this is done
by changing the wind direction to force the tornado over water, which extingushes the
fire and settles the tornado down. this unlocks the fire tornado magic somehow.
*weathervane - hitting the weathervane changes the direction of the wind. this allows
link to move the fire toronado out to sea and off the level. once this is done, the 
fire tornado magic is unlocked - or something else. i dunno.






LEVEL WIND

Mountain Dungeon Climb
wind pushes the player while they are trying to climb the mountain to the dungeon
entrance. the wind is an obj, with animated action lines, so the player can 'see' the
wind and it coming towards them - allowing them to dodge.

wind should occasionally blow thru overworld levels
this is a global push() on all objs and actors.
link would be pushed a bit.
leaves would fly out from trees, etc..
it's a very environmental thing, but adds life.

The Kusanagi Sword
this sword creates gusts of wind, which push objects
actors and projectiles (specifically ground fires).
this sword is used in a challenge where link must
push fire across a field to kill a rival warlod, via
the kusanagi legend in japan. alsoknown as the sword 
of gathering clouds.













Grass++
cut grass should grow into tall grass if near coastlines,
or filled ditches.









Big Magic Container + Frozen Smashing Damage Bonus

implement the hammer + ice bonus damage, plus the big magic
refill loot spawn. this is a special call in functions_loot,
specially made for hammers destroying iceblocks with actor or
object refs! with this check, we always spawn a big magic container.
which means, we need a big magic container.. lol..

rip this from lttps sprites.















comet magic

bombos should make non-hero actors explode via explosions
simultaneously, along with bomb circle around link.

quake shakes the screen and deals level 2 damage to everything
in the level. so it's very powerful. BUT flying objects and actors
are completely immune to it. this also means we need to write a
camera shake routine like we did in th.







Default Dungeon

the default dungeon sheet is the one we use for all
overworld / field level dungeon objects. this means
this 'dungeon' has a green grassy floor.

the pit teeth default to brown, which is part of the default
sheet. this default sheet should be thought of as the 'world' 
dungeon sheet - these pits will appear on the overworld against the
expected green bkg color. so the default pit teeth need to be green,
leading into brown as they go down into the ground. 






Coliseum++
we need 'windows' that look into the coliseum,
like the overworld sprite depicts. plus, I don't like
how the coliseum level is unbalanced and to the right.
instead, the coliseum - and all subsequent coliseums -
will be entrance centered to level, north of spawn.
this 'presents' the level much better, because coliseums
have no required puzzle for entry.

a window is a 3x4 obj, with baked in bkg.
so this saves us a lot of roomObjs.



Coliseum++++
we also need to have the large skulls be a 2nd object
that can sit on the ground, indestructible. this way
we can decorate the shadow coliseum appropriately.
we should add this skull detail to the overworld map as
well.





 





Water++

*we could have animated floating lily pads, much like the animated
flowers that sit over the grass levels. this would add some decoration
to the otherwise bland sea water.

*need to make boat anchor object - this is already in common objs,
and can be used to further decorate piers.






Implement Cane of Somara (or whatever)
this is the cane that creates blocks that are pushable.
this makes it MUCH easier to get thru dungeons, as many
rooms rely on floor switches, which link can simply
create a block over. if a block is created ontop of
a blocking roomObject, the block ...






Tall Coastlines
there is a problem with the tall coastline objs - we should be
able to dig over them, but doing so will remove the entire obj,
leaving a 16x16 ditch, instad of a 16x32 ditch to match the coastline
objs size. the green bkg will show, instead of water, breaking 
immersion. they are immune to digs for now. the solution is to 
break them up into two 16x16 objects, replace them in level,
then allow digging on the top object that transitions to land..
this trans should be based on the dirtcolor, not green, because
water doesn't transition directly to grass on islands. 
-for now tall coastlines are immune to dig-






Bag of Seeds

this simply allows link to place a bush stump, for now.
digging ditches + water tiles + bush stumps = farming.
this is next to magic mirror.

this forms the foundation of farming in the game.

when we click on the bag of beans, we should get a smaller
UI popup that lets us choose what type of seed we want.
for now, we only have bush seeds. these seeds grow bushes,
when planted next to a water source (coastline, water, filled ditch).
once the bush "grows", if its cut, it will leave a stump and
that sequence handles itself.

The Friendly Plant Seymor

-special seed, when planted, spawns a large plant that bites
any enemies near it, dealing them damage, while ignoring link.
this makes it a strategic weapon. these seeds should be limited,
unlike the infinite number of bush seeds link has.
this plant essentially dupes the tentacle actor's functionality.
-after taking a certain amount of damage, the plant dies, so it
cant block and attack in an invincible way. this means it's an actor.
when this plant grows, it spawns the actor and removes itself.

Vine To The Sky

-special seed obtained from fisherman. when planted at cloud
location will spawn a big vine into the sky that link can interact
with. for now this is just a dialog asking if player wants to climb vine,
and if so, then we load the 1st cloud level. later on, link should
be able to actually climb the vine, just like a mountain wall, but the
whole vine is a climbable foothold object. once link collides with a
light obj in the 'clouds', we load the cloud level, or we load the overworld
with link on a cloud location - which allows for much faster traversal
up the clouds later! awesome.

*requires two cloud levels, so we have to touch level data and XML>CS pipeline











Summary Screen++

Summary Screen is not properly displaying player data,
or info about any dungeon record playthrough.

dungeon records should be reset upon dungeon build.
we should be adding the dungeon data properly upon
completion too.





Display Playtime (in inventory?) keep this offscreen.

need to add timespan to playerdata to track playtime,
so we ca display it under repo name on right.
