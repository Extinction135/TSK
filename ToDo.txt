Today:




Climbing - Part 4

linked up mountain world to overworld map.
added sfx for climbing.

when hero falls off wall into water, he now
goes directly into an idle swim state, after
waiting a brisk 30 frames. if hero falls onto
land, he waits the full 60 frames, and plays 
the sitting to standing animation slowly.
this visually separates falling in water
and on land, and makes them feel different
too - adding another layer of realness to 
the world. this makes me very happy.

added trap ladders into game.
updated mountain level with trap ladders.
trap ladder object notes - this should look
partially broken. when link touches it, it breaks
and becomes nothing. this means link cant cross
the path that way, and must find another. this
is the perfect way to introduce the mountain climb.
- the old route was damaged, so link must use the
harder route over water to get to the top.

at the top is the mountain dungeon entrance.
bonus: this introduces the idea of climbing,
gives player an easy route to try out, right
next to a harder route that's also hidden to
the casual observer, so player feels clever 
for discovering it too.










Climbing - Part 5

add the mountain dungeon's entrance obj.
change the mountain dungeon's wall sprites to be
cave-y. 


*pressing A while falling should grab onto nearest foothold.
if actor is falling, they should be able to 
grab a foothold by pressing a button. pressing
a button again afterwards doesn't cancel the
climbing state. so it's ok to spam A while falling
in the hopes of grabbing on. this allows for
assassin's creed style climbing up high to fall
to catch a foothold in an unreachable area,
all based on skill and understanding of the game.

















update forest standard enemy to be angry floating eye.
- doesn't need swimming state, has same rec as hero,
so he can cast fireballs, etc...


create blob dungeon pit object - this will go on town level.
if hero collides with this obj, he falls into the blob dungeon.
this dungeon builds a critical path to the exit, which
dumps hero back out at last overworld location (or just town level).
-this moves blobs into their own dungeon, without a miniboss or boss.



mountain dungeon++
add mountain enemies, miniboss, boss.
standard enemy is? snake?





























Town++
we are going to rebuild the town level completely..
completely! with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens.





*exiting the forest dungeon placed link at colliseum.
it's likely we're not checking to see if link is exiting
a level of id.type dungeon.








Mountain Level
should be able to climb up certain rock walls, denoted with small
footholds. hold A to climb. rockwalls normally push link down (faking
gravity), but while in climbing state the push is ignored. this allows
link to literally climb up the mountain. he can't use any items while,
climbing so link has to dodge enemies until he can get to a landing to
take care of them.

the 1st field level is the basecamp and start of the mountain.
the 2nd field level is the major climbing level, and contains the
entrance to the mountain dungeon.
the 3rd field level is the summit, and contains summit related things. ???
the mountain dungeon entrance is NOT on the summit, because
it would be difficult and time consuming to climb all the way back
up when player has died in the dungeon. at the summit we could
have an overlook - which creates a screen with nice concept art and music.
like the player was looking at hyrule from atop a mountain.







Screens + ScreenManager
migrate screens to be GLOBAL. they will still inherit
from base class of screen, but this way we get to keep
the last selected menuItem, etc... 







*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.
