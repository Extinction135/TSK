0.77 playthru: https://youtu.be/_b7qclGTffE
0.78 goals:
	more items (axe, hookshot, hammer, magic mirror)
	more interaction (throwing objs, actors/objs in water, decorations)
	better dungeon traversal (X solved puzzles, marked map)
	better coliseum - uniq objs + enemies
	better overworld - more skulls, waves, cluds, vfx @skullIsland
	smaller ram - X dungeon sheets get smaller
	fix projectile spawn system + enlarge boss hitboxes
	implement bed + dream sequences - special leveldata + set hero's type + dialog prompt
	(exiting dream field ends the dream)
	(we may split bed into two objects again, to make this interaction more expected)

Bush Growth

when a bush regrows (when it's near a water tile or
ditch filled with water), it becomes a blocking object.
it transforms from a non-blocking stump into a blocking
bush (which can be destroyed easily, but still blocking).
this is important because, one consequence of this system
is that a bush can regrow on the hero, locking him 'into'
the bush, making him unable to move. we handled that with
a specific check in bush regrowth routines - but now i 
realize that this should be extended to include all actors,
simply because a bush can grow-lock minibosses or bosses,
like they did when i was playtesting 0.77 in the miniboss
room. in this room, we have a miniboss that shoots fireballs
in a room filled with water and bushes. this leads to the
cycle where fireballs burn bushes into stumps, which regrow
into bushes again. however, the bushes were grow locking
the miniboss, who would then still shoot fireballs, which
caused the fireball to immediately hit the bush, creating
an explosion, hurting the miniboss, causing him to go underwater,
and right as he popped back up - the bush would regrow -
continuing this cycle of never ending torture for the miniboss.
while this was entertaining to watch, this was not the 
intended behavior and this commit prevents this state from
being possible - simply by preventing bush regrowth if
the stump touches any actor at all. which loops over all
actors, doing a collision check, which is mildly expensive.
oh well.








we want to preserve diving for specific actor types.
this is ocotmouth, kraken, tentacle.



tentacle should have fang as item, should use item.
tentacle's swim dash needs ypos +16 offset.






projectiles should spawn based on caster's hitbox center,
then add half width or height, plus a pixel bumper, based on
the projectile's direction. each frame, the projectile
either tracks it's caster's hitbox, or performs a unique
behavior.



hero should not be able to climb walls unless he is blob
or link.










big eye boss can spawn fangs, but they hit him from certain
directions. also, he cannot spawn seekers via item use, which
he should be able to. there should be magic for this, and the
seeker should seek out the first actor that isn't it's caster.
this maintains it's behavior, while making it useful to the player
as well. this is enemy magic/items, so we can add it to the
enemy vendor as well.

boss kraken's swim waves are incorrect for swimming left/right,
the swim waves need to be pushed south 16 pixels. for swimming
north, they need to be pushed +16 pixel as well, maybe +32.
also, the boss kraken should have a magic item that spawns a
tentacle. this tentacle just makes a standard tentacle, which
will attack link and can be spawned on land. we should update
tentacles spawned in this manner to have no speed, so they spawn
unable to move. they should randomly attack in every direction too,
so link can create walls of angry tentacles, using this enemy magic.
this should probably be two types of objects honestly: tentacles
spawned by the boss (in water), and tentacles spawned by the hero
(in water or on land) which are just stationary. this preserves the
boss' implementation (using a magic item) and also gives the player 
something intresting to use (using a magic item). *actually, the 
kraken creates tentacle ACTORS, which seek hero. hero could create
tentacle OBJS, using same sprites, that could attack random directions
and form useful walls. this would also be the first instance of
creating roomObjs by the hero/player.

tentacle special actor should have the fang equipped for his
ITEM, because he is in the water, and X causes him to dive. we have
to preserve this state in order for hero to fully function, so
enemies in the water can only use items, never weapons, limiting them
to one type of attack. right now, tentacle actors










-PLS DO THIS NOW, IT'S HOLDING THE PROJECTILE SPAWN SYSTEM HOSTAGE-
Actor Refs

a projectile's caster should be an actor reference.
if a projectile's caster is null, then it should have no behavior.
this is because some gameobjects cast projectiles,
but in that case the projectile wouldn't have any behavior
related to the caster.

this simplifies the current system for handling projectiles,
which uses the moveComponent. using this moveComp, projectile.update
attempts to prevent projectiles from ovrelapping with their casters,
but this is based on the compMove and not the hitBox, which is
actually the target of importance. we need to have access to
the entire actor object, not just it's compMove! we need to
touch the actor's hitBox from projectile.update, and we can't currently.
once we do this, we can check and align projectiles to the actor's
hitBox, and then larger enemies can have larger hitboxes while also
being able to cast projectiles...
plus, projectiles could properly implement their behaviors - by
tracking the actor's hitbox instead of their newPosition..

Improve Projectile.Spawn()

*miniboss cant shoot fireballs south - why?
?= pro.spawn() assumes that the actor's collRec is 16x16 - it shouldn't.
this means only 16x16 actors can safely shoot fireballs without damaging
themselves, which is some valve level stupid. this method should take
the actor as a parameter, and then we should base the offsets FOR ALL
PROJECTILES off of the actor's collision rec width and height. this
would allow larger actors, like bosses, to SHOOT FIREBALLS. geez.

Special Attacks / Boss "USE"
bigeye uses the shut + bloodshot frames for his special.
bigeye: spawns A TON of exploding seekers while in his special.






























Default Dungeon
the default dungeon sheet is the one we use for all
overworld / field level dungeon objects. this means
this 'dungeon' has a green grassy floor.

visual bugs: 
bottom spike lip of pit competes with middle pit black obj.
also, the pit teeth default to brown, which is part of the default
sheet. this default sheet should be thought of as the 'world' 
dungeon sheet - these pits will appear on the overworld against the
expected green bkg color. so the default pit teeth need to be green,
leading into brown as they go down into the ground. 


Coliseum++
we need 'windows' that look into the coliseum,
like the overworld sprite depicts. plus, I don't like
how the coliseum level is unbalanced and to the right.
instead, the coliseum - and all subsequent coliseums -
will be entrance centered to level, north of spawn.
this 'presents' the level much better, because coliseums
have no required puzzle for entry.

a window is a 3x4 obj, with baked in bkg.
so this saves us a lot of roomObjs.


Coliseum++++
we also need to have the large skulls be a 2nd object
that can sit on the ground, indestructible. this way
we can decorate the shadow coliseum appropriately.
we should add this skull detail to the overworld map as
well.





Roofs++
remove rear roofs from the overlap check - now hero
can't peek into houses by walking behind them - he has
to be underneath the main part or the chimney.





Grass++

cut grass should grow into tall grass if near coastlines,
or filled ditches. 





Water++

*we could have animated floating lily pads, much like the animated
flowers that sit over the grass levels. this would add some decoration
to the otherwise bland sea water.

*need to make boat anchor object - this is already in common objs,
and can be used to further decorate piers.





Magic Mirror
use it in a dungeon to return to the exit (starting room). 
exiting dungeon takes us to field.
it can only be used in dungeons, and it's partially broken.
it's use in the shadow dungeon is different, as it transfers
link from the darkworld to the lightworld version, and does
not take link back to the starting (exit) room.

the history of why the magic mirror is broken can be explained.

- plays warp sound fx
should call Level.BuildLevel(Level.ID),
which will cause the level to fade in from black,
and place hero at the entrance the dungeon again.
*this should only work in a dungeon. 






Overworld++
we need more skulls around the shadowking's island and sea. keep
the shadow skull area sparse, cause it's going to be animated,
and it will never 'collapse'




Exploit : Trap Door Pit Teleport

the fix is simply to remove trap doors from the
routine that sets the last 'touched' door / active door.
in fact, only open doors should be set as the last / active door.
the other exploit is to touch a trap door or closed door to
set your respawn point, which is not what i want.


Implement Cane of Somara (or whatever)
this is the cane that creates blocks that are pushable.
this makes it MUCH easier to get thru dungeons, as many
rooms rely on floor switches, which link can simply
create a block over. if a block is created ontop of
a blocking roomObject, the block ...





Room keys - these only work for the room and only unlock 1 door, and
these rooms turn all their doors into locked doors upon close, similar to puzzled rooms
link doesn't put them into inventory - he literally picks them up and walks over
to a locked door and collides with it. link should also be able to throw keys into
locked doors, which means we need to throw objects directly in line from link,
which simplifies how objs are thrown ALOT, and makes their throws more predictable.

this is kinda like super mario world style key gameplay.
if obj.type == key & obj.hitBox.intersects lockedDoor.hitBox,
convert lockedDoor to openDoor, release() key.
- or - we put the key as a menuItem in inventory,
and clear that inventory item when link enters a new room (pre-build).

Keys!!!
**we could have 'keys' in the game, which would be temporary for the room only
the doors would shut and convert to locked versions, or only some of them would.
inside the room is a chest that contains a key. hero picks up the key, unlocks 
a door, key is used, continues on. the room resets, works the same later on.
the key would be displayed in the inventory screen as a brittle rusty key.
and when it's used, the key breaks. the flavor text says that the key will
likely break after one use.

we could lock one door randomly, or we could lock ALL THE DOORS, and then 
force the player to choose which door they want to unlock.




Explosion Surfing (Bomb Jumping)

if an actor is hit, simply put them into a flying state.
this will cause the actor to be able to fly across pits for a moment,
but when the hit state ends, if they overlap the pit, they
will be pulled in. but, this does allow a type of bomb jumping,
or rather "explosion surfing". which sounds so much better.

we could even put the actor into a 2nd type of hit state,
a staggered state, which would hold the actor in the hit state for
longer, allowing them to fly for longer, allowing them to cross
single tile pits safely - and only an explosion would be able
to set an actor into this 2nd staggered hit state.

which, staggered seems like a poor name for this state.
likely should be something like ExplosiveThrow, 
so we know the actor is being thrown by an explosion.

we can implement this now and ensure that bomb jumping is not
only preserved, but supported officially in this game, and is
known as explosion surfing, because you can also use fireballs
to do these type of explosive throwing tricks.




Speed++
slow finish / build becuase we call cleanRoom() twice, which is dumb af
in dungeon / room routines.
