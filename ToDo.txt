Gif Capture process:
	run game in release mode
	run LiceCap, expand capture area past program window about 10 pixels on each side
	record at 30fps, open in photoshop and crop the frame down to just the game view (minus window title)
	reduce image size by half, down to original size so pixels are 1:1 ratio
	save as PSD master, then begin cutting out sections/edits
	the default time per frame (set by licecap) is perfect, do not change this
	save for web ->  GIF 32 Dithered, filesize should be under 3mb, loop forever
	test in browser to ensure proper fps
adding music:
	files are saved as .ogg and added to content pipeline, built on high quality.
	keep these files stereo, but at 22k.
adding sound effects:
	sound effects should be compressed down to 22K sample rate, mono, 16bit
VS shortcuts
	CTRL + M, O = collapse functions/regions	
new gif: 50% nearest neighbor, 32 dithered
adding a cheat:
	add value to MenuItemType enum (cheat starts as a selectable menu item)
	update MenuItem.SetType() to set cheat menuItem descriptions, titles, and initial frame.
	add menuItem to Cheat Screen.
	link neighbors, add effect, add check to SetCheatMenuItems(), playtest.
Adding GameObjs:
	make enum defs, make animFrames,
	set objType paths, add to env obj widget
	playtest in field.

v0.8 goals

- the "shadow system"
every actor has a shadow, based on the actor size and flying state.
larger actor = large shadow, flying actor = smaller shadow (due to height off ground)
every object has a shadow, based on the obj type, size, and state.
these shadows maybe visible or not. these shadows should track to the
objects/actors each frame, AFTER the compMove component has finished processing.
these shadows are sprites that are added to actors and gameobj classes.
this will likely be part of pool, possibly just prior to drawing to ensure
they are always aligned to their obj/actor (altho this does pollute Draw)..

- houses, includes buildings, beds, interior objs

- Non-room repeating Dungeon, additional rooms
- Flying Dungeon Enemy, Minor Overworld Enemies
- Blob AI improvements - sword, arrow, bomb based on weapon / item loadout 
- blob loadouts could be randomized when room is built()

- EndlessForest Demo (shows off gameplay, complete on it's own, camera tracks to hero).
- this is randomly placed bushes / trees / grass + ANY enemy type
- room rec tracks to hero, expanded room rec cleans up anything that doesn't touch it
- as room moves, *generate random stuff just OUTSIDE of room rec*
- this means, as hero moves he is always 'finding' new stuff, even if he doubles back
- npc outside endless forest dialog = "once you go in, there's no way out..."
- later on implement magic mirror, which returns hero to overworld screen

- LIGHT WORLD & DARK WORLD
- implement enumFields for building rooms (big optimization)

- create 'boat' level, with boat captain, who has dialog with link
- offers to take link to a variety of locations, using vendor screen
- only available location is water temple, for low gold price (since link 'hires' crew)
- this level is the boat obj + a dungeon entrance obj + a bunch of water tiles (maybe a small island)
- links path is to/from the boat to the dungeon entrance

- water temple / swamp dungeon: 
	build crit path to hub, crit path to key, crit path to boss, 
	*crit path to water switch (pullable lever)
	*place water switch randomly in room/hub room
	water pullable lever flips high/low water level boolean
	when rooms are built they build high or low water levels, 
	low water levels prevent hero from passing thru rooms 
	there are low water levels in rooms along the key or boss crit path.
	hero must flip switch to access key or boss rooms, or not.
	boss is tentacles squid
	
- mountain dungeon (diff enemies, boss, dungeon sprites - but same rooms)

- room keys - these only work for the room and only unlock 1 door, and
these rooms turn all their doors into locked doors upon close, similar to puzzled rooms
link doesn't put them into inventory, he literally picks them up and takes
them to the door to unlock it. this is super mario style key gameplay.
if link's heldObj == small key, then link's interaction with locked door makes it open.
and heldObj is released().


















Thursday
	- implement shovel weapon
	- create ditch sprite, ground can become ditch (any objs are removed, like grass)
	- shovel interaction with non-blocking obj removes obj and creates ditch obj.
	- ditch objs have 16x16 collrec, and look like 'deep dirt', a layer under ground.
	- the same way fire spreads (using interactive frame), we can spread water tiles
	- water tiles expand for one frame and make ditch tiles water tiles if they touch
	- then we need to implement cascading effect: low, med, high water tiles.
	- high > med > low > ditch is the spreading routine.
	- at this point link should be able to construct water channels
	
TRENCH SYSTEM (OMG I DID IT)

how to make trench system work:
the initial trench obj placed is a temp obj with a 20x20 collision rec.
on it's first frame, it checks to see what trench objs overlap it.
using the list of overlapping trenches nearby, sort to a NSEW boolean list.
(this is done by comparing new trench sprite pos to neighbor sprite pos.)
then we can switch the type of the trench just placed to 'fit' into
it's neighboring trenches. N+S = vertical. E+W = horizontal.
N+(E/W) etc = corner trench. N+S+E+W = quad trench. we only need 3 trench sprites. lol.
this makes it easy to propagate water thru them too, as we would then
have low, med, filled sprite versions of the trench.

we will also need 'end caps' that connect to straight pieces.
and trenches that are just single holes in the ground.


* add windmill obj that animates if a filled trench obj touches it
in the right neighboring tile.


**** playtest as much as you can thursday ****



Friday
	- record playthrus and examples of gameplay, post. 
	- release v0.72.
	- update readme.

	- create archive releases for v0.1 - v0.7. (fork, revert, release, delete.)
	- later, we can compare gameplay across versions.
	- note this is only for Dx version. UWP version tracking should start with v0.7.
	- these version archives should remain local, outside of repo folder.
	- *we should be able to record via the a20s just fine, via obs.
	
	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	



TODAY:





Objects Sinking into Water

Certain objects should sink into water when they contact a
water tile. These are draggable objects, since hero can
push them to a position where they look like they're floating
over water, while hero falls in. This breaks immersion.
Now, if hero pushes these objects into water, they will
be released() and a splash particle will be created.

so, it's working, but i think the object that's being
pushed falls into the water too early. instead we should
check the center of object for interaction collisions
with the water tile. updated and playtested, working 
perfectly now. objs being pushed fall into water
at the same time link does, so the game concept of 
water tiles having 'depth' is maintained. whew.








SoundFX++
only the hero should make 'movement' sounds.
enemies shouldn't. it's annoying after a few minutes.
and it seems buggy, if link is standing on land not moving,
while the water walk sound fx spam plays, because theres an
enemy off screen playing around on the coastlines.





*add in wooden table, should be easily destructable (handle common obj)
**we have a glass table too, right? git rid of it. we have no glass sfx and it has no point.







Bosses / Enemies ++
*we have big eye boss, with hit state and idle blink,
so we *could* make him the boss of the dungeon, and move big blob
into the hub as a miniBoss, which would be awesome.

phase1: the boss floats around, running away from hero.
after a certain amount of damage, the boss pops a dialog (freezing action)
this dialog talks about how the dev needs to add in the boss attack and phases.
