Release 0.74 - The Colliseum

the major addition 0.74 brings is The
Colliseum, a place where link can purchase
challenges. A challenge is a set of enemies,
with a reward. If link defeats all the
enemies, then he gets the reward. Otherwise,
link dies, is kicked out of the colliseum to
the overworld screen, and has to buy the
challenge again. for now, there are 3
challenges that are all pretty crazy and fun.

there's also been a ton of smaller 
improvements to the overall game,
along with many layers of polish.
