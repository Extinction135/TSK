1.0 - official release



Today:







Minibosses ++

create 2 armored spiders in hub room for mountain.
create 3 octomouths in hub room for swamp.
this is a linear difficulty increase.







kraken should move around more.
ocotomouths should move around more too.












swamp rooms ++
swamp dungeon should be diff than mountain dungeon
in size and complexity. because it takes longer to
move in water, it will feel like the dungeon is harder
on a base level, so the dungeon shouldnt be that large
or complex. we're also going to be adding a water lever
critical path into this dungeon, so it needs to remain
about the size of the forest dungeon. the boss room
should connect to the hub room as well.

we desperatly need to improve the ugly swamp wall sprtes.
fix this to look slimy and grotesque.







this means we need to implement hub/boss approach for 
square, column, row rooms. 




Exits++
we should be able to make exits specific to dungeons as
well. they should visually introduce the dungeon, as well
as any basic mechanics: for example the swamp exit should
transtion from land to water, from the exit door obj. this
symbolizes that this dungeon uses alot of water tiles.


















forest level redesign -
a horizontal set of trees block the dungeon entrance.
the entrance is surrounded by indestructible objs.
player HAS TO BURN down the trees to get access to dungeon.
this teaches player objs can be destroyed.
bonus: grass under the trees should act as a fuse for a
massive forest fire across the whole level. kinda like it
does now, but better.






Mountain Sprites
add black pixels to the corners of the mountain wall sprites.
this will make the rooms appear rounded, which further visually
separates them. 




Colliseum Entrance Obj++
the colliseum entrance obj should just be a wide black entrance,
like the center sprite. we dupe that for a total of 3, so we have
a massive entrance. then put those skull pillars on the side. why?
to match the entrance/exit sizes between the colliseum levels.
the exit from the interior is pretty wide, so the entrance
should be wide as well.







it would be nice to show the currently selected objects
important parameters, like moveable, grounded, etc..
we could put this info next to the object in the objTools
widget, if we extende the widget.


footholds were pushed off the mountain wall.
i assume a frame of interaction happened prior to
the roomObj types being updated. 
*when we reset the pool, stopMovement() on all objs.









Release version 0.76
test install on windows10 via Dx.
test install/run on xbox one via UWP.
print media for 0.76 (main gif, playthru video).
update readme with links.





























really important things that i should really fix i think?



Polish + Fixes

explosions should push roomObjects that they touch.
that are moveable. that dont get destroyed?
are explosions pushing objects?


rats and crabs should "bite", but turtles dont.
all types can be picked up and carried, but rats
and crabs will eventually bite link, causing link
to throw the creature and take 1 damage.






Actor Refs

a projectile's caster should be an actor reference.
if a projectile's caster is null, then it should have no behavior.
this is because some gameobjects cast projectiles,
but in that case the projectile wouldn't have any behavior
related to the caster.

this simplifies the current system for handling projectiles,
which uses the moveComponent. using this moveComp, projectile.update
attempts to prevent projectiles from ovrelapping with their casters,
but this is based on the compMove and not the hitBox, which is
actually the target of importance. we need to have access to
the entire actor object, not just it's compMove! we need to
touch the actor's hitBox from projectile.update, and we can't currently.
once we do this, we can check and align projectiles to the actor's
hitBox, and then larger enemies can have larger hitboxes while also
being able to cast projectiles...
plus, projectiles could properly implement their behaviors - by
tracking the actor's hitbox instead of their newPosition..
