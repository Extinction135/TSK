Today:






Repo Migration

semi-migrated repo to tsk naming convention,
breaking all forks. i'm kinda scared to manually
alter the cs project solution files for all the
ports, so for now they'll stay named 'dungeonrun'.

changed watermark link to repo (shorter), and
updated window title.

sync'd changes to uwp port as well.
455 changes to master? alright.












Cleanup

clean up IDEAS - removing ideas : completed, infeasible, stupid



Moving Forward

update design.md with more topics.
update versions page with words discussing development of 0.76 and
0.77, including the overworld development process.


REMAKE ROADMAP
- things have changed dramatically, since we've done so much.






Playtesting Bugs

purchased bow, left level, bow was gone.
stop messing with player save data directly,
just write to the autosave file instead, this
forces player to save their progress each time
they exit, via the reminder screen.

upon dying, loadout is reset. dont do that.

the summary screen resets it's values to 0 after
first run, but upon second run those values dont
increase to show player progress. either the summ
screen is messed up or the dungeon record is not
being updated for the dungeon playthrough.

barrels should have explosion/destruction noise
they have null sfx
