Today:





Prep for Mountains 

added dungeon entrances to master sheet.
added light world forest dungeon entrance
to forest sheet. added building objects
to colliseum sheet, in case we want to 
actually make buildings outside the
colliseum. this means building sprites
are required, but can be unique, 
for each sheet.

moved bed object into the required dungeon
section of each sheet - i guess we're 
committing to the dream idea. added dirty
bed animFrame too.

moved skull pillar. ensured forest and 
colliseum reserved dungeon sections meet
new requirements (beds, skull pillar).

created mountain section in master.psd.
this dupes the world and dungeon sections
from forest/colliseum.









* the building widgets object is now GLOBAL
for ALL sheets. EVERY sheet MUST implement
buildings, which they all do now.
so this widget is handled like the env+dungeon widgets.



*exiting the forest dungeon placed link at colliseum.
it's likely we're not checking to see if link is exiting
a level of id.type dungeon.











Mountain Level
should be able to climb up certain rock walls, denoted with small
footholds. hold A to climb. rockwalls normally push link down (faking
gravity), but while in climbing state the push is ignored. this allows
link to literally climb up the mountain. he can't use any items while,
climbing so link has to dodge enemies until he can get to a landing to
take care of them.

the 1st field level is the basecamp and start of the mountain.
the 2nd field level is the major climbing level, and contains the
entrance to the mountain dungeon.
the 3rd field level is the summit, and contains summit related things. ???
the mountain dungeon entrance is NOT on the summit, because
it would be difficult and time consuming to climb all the way back
up when player has died in the dungeon. at the summit we could
have an overlook - which creates a screen with nice concept art and music.
like the player was looking at hyrule from atop a mountain.







Screens + ScreenManager
migrate screens to be GLOBAL. they will still inherit
from base class of screen, but this way we get to keep
the last selected menuItem, etc... 


Level
update level and level functions to be more reasonable.
we currently do something like funs_level.currentRoom and that's
just stupid - it should be Level.Room.




*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.
