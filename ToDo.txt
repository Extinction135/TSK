Today:




Climbing - Part 5

added mountain dungeon entrance obj to game
and mountain level. added more areas to the 
mountain level, just for sport climbing.

linked up mountain dungeon entrance to build
the default forest dungeon (for testing rn).

updated overworld with return paths for
forest and mountain dungeons and entrance
levels. this fixes a bug with overworld
level where exiting forest dungeon placed
link at the colliseum.

tested exiting mountain entrance level
returns link to cave map location < yep.
also, exiting forest dungeon from mountain
entrance level returns link to cave location.

bug: using shovel, mountainwalls, footholds,
ladders can all be 'dug removed'. updated Dig
routine to prevent objs of group mountainWall
from being removed. fixed bug with digging.

playtested, working beautifully.






**mountain walls dont push roomObjs, like
TURTLES, so roomobjs enemies can walk right over em,
completely breaking immersion...




*pressing A while falling should grab onto nearest foothold.
if actor is falling, they should be able to 
grab a foothold by pressing a button. pressing
a button again afterwards doesn't cancel the
climbing state. so it's ok to spam A while falling
in the hopes of grabbing on. this allows for
assassin's creed style climbing up high to fall
to catch a foothold in an unreachable area,
all based on skill and understanding of the game.








Mountain Dungeon

mountain entrance should create mountain dungeon.
this is a separate dungeon, with a diff dungeon recipe
than forest dungeon. no variation from critical path
approach - exit > hub > key > boss.

we need mountain dungeon wall sprites that actually look cave-y.

add mountain enemies, miniboss, boss.
standard enemy is? snake?









Separate Blob and Forest Dungeons

update forest standard enemy to be angry floating eye.
- doesn't need swimming state, has same rec as hero,
so he can cast fireballs, etc...

create blob dungeon pit object - this will go on town level.
if hero collides with this obj, he falls into the blob dungeon.
this dungeon builds a critical path to the exit, which
dumps hero back out at last overworld location (or just town level).
-this moves blobs into their own dungeon, without a miniboss or boss.






































Town++
we are going to rebuild the town level completely..
completely! with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens.













Mountain Level
should be able to climb up certain rock walls, denoted with small
footholds. hold A to climb. rockwalls normally push link down (faking
gravity), but while in climbing state the push is ignored. this allows
link to literally climb up the mountain. he can't use any items while,
climbing so link has to dodge enemies until he can get to a landing to
take care of them.

the 1st field level is the basecamp and start of the mountain.
the 2nd field level is the major climbing level, and contains the
entrance to the mountain dungeon.
the 3rd field level is the summit, and contains summit related things. ???
the mountain dungeon entrance is NOT on the summit, because
it would be difficult and time consuming to climb all the way back
up when player has died in the dungeon. at the summit we could
have an overlook - which creates a screen with nice concept art and music.
like the player was looking at hyrule from atop a mountain.







Screens + ScreenManager
migrate screens to be GLOBAL. they will still inherit
from base class of screen, but this way we get to keep
the last selected menuItem, etc... 







*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.
