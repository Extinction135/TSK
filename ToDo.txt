Today:


Story++

revised story, roadmap/milestones, reorganized
ideas and todo. special focus on zelda's two sided
dialogs as the king. heavily changed story once
plot gets to darkworld.








Pets++
create swimming movement frames for dog.
should be same pixels - just partially submerged


Boomerangs++
boomerangs should push rats, turtles, crabs..
we should really be modeling this as an objectGroup
we need an ObjGroup value for enemies,
then we can just boomerang check against enemy objGroup
..this might simplify some routines in the future as well

update the boomerang ui sprite to look like the ingame
version: black with a white marker

why can't we pick up rats? they are roomObjs


Map++
Make the map a roomObj.
link colliding with it should set reward state, pop map reward
particle, flip map boolean. miniboss should spawn map pickup obj,
if miniboss dies in hub room, and hero doesn't have map.

*map sprite should bounce and be SUPER noticeable.
the player should have to choose NOT to pick it up.

MapScreen++
add lttp's map title to dungeon map screen, outside of
the scroll sprite. rename map window title to nothing.



Reading Signs
we need to be able to read signposts properly
this is based on the current room/level.
only 1 signpost is allowed per room, extending to fields.
so, for overworld levels, there can only be 1 signpost.
and it can only say one thing, because it's based
on the room.id. and this will be contained within
a method called ReadSign(GameObject SignPost).











------ RELEASE 0.74 --------

create the gameplay page in the repo, and start
filling it with examples of gameplay gifs (with text notes):

moving & dashing
attacking, using items, inventory
colliseum fighting
grass fires + burning objects
swimming, swim dashing 
pickup, throw, dash carry
sneaking, swimming underwater
buildings, roofs, destruction
Vendors + NPCs
minibosses + bosses
dungeon type, size, variety
environments + levels

record a gif showing off colliseum fights for 0.74.
delete versions page entirely.






EDITOR +++++++++

editor++
it would be nice to be able to toggle roofs on/off.
and hide their collisionrecs too, so we can't accidentally pick them up.
it would also be nice to "lock" water tiles somehow, so we can't
mess them up. maybe different selection modes: landscape, building.
it would be nice to be able to drag select a rec around a set of objects,
then move them with the arrow keys, in 16 pixel increments. this would allow
us to edit parts of rooms just like we edit pixels in photoshop.





Magic Mirror
- returns link to dungeon entrance.
- plays warp sound fx
should call Level.BuildLevel(Level.ID),
which will cause the level to fade in from black,
and place hero at the entrance the dungeon again.
*this should only work in a dungeon. 
*magic mirror doesn't warp hero out of dark world
back to light world like lttp did. 
instead, magic mirror "reflects link's true image,
keeping him human in the dark world".

Whe link is first pulled into the dark world,
his magic mirror should get cracked, so he becomes
the familiar bunny again. this time he has to seek 
out someone who can repair his magic mirror before
he can become himself again. during this time,
bunny link can only walk, dash, interact, pickup,
throw, hide/sneak, swim, dive, and swim dash.
no attacking or using items. the idea is to 
make this part of the game a stealth mission:
sneak past the overpowering enemies as a bunny,
repair your magic mirror, and THEN fight.
