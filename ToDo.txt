Today:







Editor++

migrated building object widget to be shared
between all current sheets / levels - because
building objects/sprites are now required by
all sheets.

moved where widget objects are placed in editor
menu, based on the new idea of sharing the
buildings widget.

moved skull pillar into the shared dungeon
objects widget, because it's a shared object.

changed names for forest widgets to be more
neutral - forest1 and forest2. consolidated
all forest objects from 1 into 2. 1 is blank.

add basic mountain objects to mountain sheet.








are gates specific to the forest level?
they seem specific to the TOWN level, which 
should probably be it's own sheet. and buildings
seem specific to the TOWN level as well, so 
perhaps they aren't global..



sheets / levels:

town - buildings, interior objects
forest - large trees
mountain - climbable walls
colliseum - exterior & interior objs + spectators

shared: ditches, water, grass, foilage














*exiting the forest dungeon placed link at colliseum.
it's likely we're not checking to see if link is exiting
a level of id.type dungeon.











Mountain Level
should be able to climb up certain rock walls, denoted with small
footholds. hold A to climb. rockwalls normally push link down (faking
gravity), but while in climbing state the push is ignored. this allows
link to literally climb up the mountain. he can't use any items while,
climbing so link has to dodge enemies until he can get to a landing to
take care of them.

the 1st field level is the basecamp and start of the mountain.
the 2nd field level is the major climbing level, and contains the
entrance to the mountain dungeon.
the 3rd field level is the summit, and contains summit related things. ???
the mountain dungeon entrance is NOT on the summit, because
it would be difficult and time consuming to climb all the way back
up when player has died in the dungeon. at the summit we could
have an overlook - which creates a screen with nice concept art and music.
like the player was looking at hyrule from atop a mountain.







Screens + ScreenManager
migrate screens to be GLOBAL. they will still inherit
from base class of screen, but this way we get to keep
the last selected menuItem, etc... 


Level
update level and level functions to be more reasonable.
we currently do something like funs_level.currentRoom and that's
just stupid - it should be Level.Room.




*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.
