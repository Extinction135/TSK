0.76

explosions should push roomObjects that they touch.
that are moveable. that dont get destroyed?
are explosions pushing objects?

add a 'clean room' button - removes all roomObjs
not of group wall or door. thats it.
leaves us with a blank room with walls, doors,
statues, and floors.
add this button to a new widget.. somewhere..


rats and crabs should "bite", but turtles dont.
all types can be picked up and carried, but rats
and crabs will eventually bite link, causing link
to throw the creature and take 1 damage.


it would be nice to show the currently selected objects
important parameters, like moveable, grounded, etc..
we could put this info next to the object in the objTools
widget, if we extende the widget.





implement blob dungeon.
standard actor is blob.

Blob Dungeon + Overworld Pit

overworld pit is a non-blocking obj, 16x16,
that is placed somewhere in town level. hero
touching this pit causes hero to fall, level to
close, leading to blob dungeon.

Blob Dungeon
starts in an empty square room, the landing room.
in the landing room, the center area is empty,
and this is where hero spawns. there is no exit.
there is a small blob child NPC that will give
link the map, if link talks to the NPC. NPC is
invincible otherwise.

build path to hub room. (this is where we can load
the blob hub room with vendors, etc..)
build path to exit room. (we can have custom blob
exit room data here too)
add rooms, connect with secrets x2.
blob dungeons should be small and easy, without
miniboss or boss - like training wheels dungeon.



Separate Blob and Forest Dungeons

* the blob dungeon uses the town sheet *

create blob dungeon pit object - this will go on town level.
if hero collides with this obj, he falls into the blob dungeon.
this dungeon builds a critical path to the exit, which
dumps hero back out at last overworld location (or just town level).
-this moves blobs into their own dungeon, without a miniboss or boss.


add an entrance to the blob dungeon (this is pit obj)
from the town level. we can also move some npcs from 
the town level to the farm level, as it seems very
lonely there as is.


DaBlobs
the blobs live in the underworld, literally underground
of the light world. the have an entire culture, men, women,
and children. but they all look the same. they have thier own
building architecture. as blob link, you are mistaken for the
fabled hero blob that is told of in prophecy that will save
the blob people. this gives blob link an entire side plot
that doesn't touch the main plot.

Blob world
this is actually a series of rooms like a dungeon, but without
a hub room or boss room, and the hero's critical path is OUT
of the dungeon TO THE EXIT ROOM. this returns link to the overworld
map screen. in this blob dungeon city, there are rooms with buildings,
commerce, life. the blobs basically live in an underground dungeon.

as human link, the blobs will just ignore you with random dismissive
dialog. if you attack a NPC, the game spawns blob actors at all NPC
locations, then removes the NPCs - the end result being that the blobs
pickup swords and defend themselves from the evil human who attacked them.
we can also model this change using a boolean so future rooms spawn
blob enemies instead of NPCs.

as blob link, NPCs respond normally and all vendors are unlocked.
there is a spot reserved for the blob's sidequest in the hero's inventory.

How do we leave blob world?
the exit to the blob world is marked on the map, which the hero
gets from a helpful child blob in the room where hero's spawns into
blob dungeon. this is like a first peace offerring to tell player
that maybe they don't need to attack the blobs.



Town++
we are going to rebuild the town level completely..
completely! with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens, add chickens. hitting a chicken should
make it cluck, of course.













TITLE SCREEN + TEST AI
*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.













add to forest dungeon:
eye statue - doesn't attack, can be picked up like turtle. 
doesnt move. hand placed.

floating sm eye - randomly floats around, explodes if near hero,
hand placed.





release polished 0.75... 









for now, all actors are using the same hitbox.
the hero's hitbox. so some enemies are really hard to
hit, because visually it looks like they are bigger
than their hitbox says they are in-game. this has been
fine so far, but we want MORE CONTROL over hitboxes...
-related to-
projectiles++
projectiles should be cast based on the caster's collision rec.
spawn() should account for collision rec and always spawn projectile
in a position that isn't overlapping caster's hitBox. this allows bosses
to spawn projectiles, since their collision rec isn't the same size
as heros, and we're basing all our projectile spawns off hero's hitbox.
this is a pretty important change.
