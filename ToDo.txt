------ RELEASE 0.74 --------

create the gameplay page in the repo, and start
filling it with examples of gameplay gifs (with text notes):

moving & dashing
attacking, using items, inventory
colliseum fighting
grass fires + burning objects
swimming, swim dashing 
pickup, throw, dash carry
sneaking, swimming underwater
buildings, roofs, destruction
Vendors + NPCs
minibosses + bosses
dungeon type, size, variety
environments + levels

record a gif showing off colliseum fights for 0.74.
delete versions page entirely.






EDITOR +++++++++

editor++
it would be nice to be able to toggle roofs on/off.
and hide their collisionrecs too, so we can't accidentally pick them up.
it would also be nice to "lock" water tiles somehow, so we can't
mess them up. maybe different selection modes: landscape, building.
it would be nice to be able to drag select a rec around a set of objects,
then move them with the arrow keys, in 16 pixel increments. this would allow
us to edit parts of rooms just like we edit pixels in photoshop.





Magic Mirror
- returns link to dungeon entrance.
- plays warp sound fx
should call Level.BuildLevel(Level.ID),
which will cause the level to fade in from black,
and place hero at the entrance the dungeon again.
*this should only work in a dungeon. 
*magic mirror doesn't warp hero out of dark world
back to light world like lttp did. 
instead, magic mirror "reflects link's true image,
keeping him human in the dark world".

Whe link is first pulled into the dark world,
his magic mirror should get cracked, so he becomes
the familiar bunny again. this time he has to seek 
out someone who can repair his magic mirror before
he can become himself again. during this time,
bunny link can only walk, dash, interact, pickup,
throw, hide/sneak, swim, dive, and swim dash.
no attacking or using items. the idea is to 
make this part of the game a stealth mission:
sneak past the overpowering enemies as a bunny,
repair your magic mirror, and THEN fight.
