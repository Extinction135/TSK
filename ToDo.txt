Today:






Bosses++

bat boss: opens his wings and spews forth bat projectiles at
the hero, who must run and dodge the waterfall of flying bats.
update mountain dungeon to use bat boss.

fixed bat boss sprite to be 2x3, saving much space.

added story booleans to player data to track
completion of forest and mountain dungeons.
linked the death of each boss (in their boss 
room) to these booleans.

updated FinishBossRoom() to create different
bosses based on the level.id.

implemented ai for big bat, adding bite attack
if hero gets too close to boss. upgraded big 
eye to use bite attack as well.

changed Actor.SetCollisionRec() to use hero's
hitBox values for ALL actors including big
bosses - so big eye is going to be hard to hit.
this was done so that both bosses can use the
fang weapon, allowing them to Bite attack hero,
if hero gets close enough to them. this is the
exact same approach used by angry eye.

changed big eye boss strategy: phase 1 (above
10 hp) this boss creates seeker exploders very
often. once his health dips below 10, he stops
creating seekers and starts chasing the hero,
relying on his bite attack instead.

fixed bug with big eye setting his attack state
to true when he spawned a seeeker, which caused
him to bite, which destroyed the seeker (sometimes)
but more importantly - spammed the enemy taunt
sound effect. so that HAD to be stopped.

upgraded bat boss to have 3 phases, each distinct
from the last in terms of strategy. phase 1 the bat
just wanders around rarely shooting bat swarms, but
always biting hero if he gets too close. phase 2
is where he picks up and really starts spamming the
bat swarms, which kinda feels like bullethell,
sometimes. also, the boss chases hero during
phase 2. in phase 3, boss moves towards back of
room and spams the bat magic in a last attempt.

added bat boss 1v1 to collisuem challenges,
and it's awesome. really awesome. the bat's
final stand strategy turns his battle into 
a bullet hell at the last minute and I love it.

updated battle routines to prevent bat boss from
taking damage from bat projectiles (which he 
spawns profusely). this prevents him from taking
damage while he moves around in his bullethell.

updated bat boss ai to move to center of room
and spawn bat projectiles in all directions as
a final attempt to kill player.

removed push particles from taunting routines
for miniboss and bosses. LOTS of testing.

slowed down bat projectiles.
added 50/50 chance for bat boss to do super
special attack while in phase 3. this limits
the bullet hell, which is unbearable at full
throttle while in the tiny boss room..

dialed back colliseum challenges to be more
realistic in nature: 2v1 minibosses, and
1v1 bosses.













SleepingBat
sleeping bat roomObject: uses the upside down
bat sprite from mountain's 31,0 frame. when hero
gets close enough, this obj becomes a bat projectile,
with a direction towards hero's last position.
this means bat doesn't track hero, so hero can move.
also, bat pro has randomness applied to it's spawn,
so it's very likely the bat will move unpredictably,
but it will at least be moving towards hero.

put sleeping bats on the mountain entrance level.
DO NOT put these objs in dungeon room data.







Miniboss++
spider miniboss: has 2 phases: armored and not armored.
starts off armored, at half health armor 'breaks' via
shatter soundfx and multiple rising smoke particles.
unarmored version moves faster and attacks more often.
and taunts. and smokes like other minis/bosses.




Bat World Enemy
bat world enemy: bat flys towards hero and bites
him. if bat creates a bite projectile, bat removes itself.
*the difference between world bat and beefy bat is that
beefy bat can bite multiple times and has 2 hp.





this complete implementation of mountain dungeon, so far.
- technially 0.75 is done at this point. -








exterior colliseum floors really do need to be lighter...




Enemy Items VENDOR
enemy items exist in the last slot of
each type - item, weapon, armor, equipment..
meaning hero can only hold one of them at a time.
the only place to get these items is from the enemy
items vendor, located outside the colliseum (for now).




rats and crabs should "bite", but turtles dont.
all types can be picked up and carried, but rats
and crabs will eventually bite link, causing link
to throw the creature and take 1 damage.









implement blob dungeon.
standard actor is blob.

Blob Dungeon + Overworld Pit

overworld pit is a non-blocking obj, 16x16,
that is placed somewhere in town level. hero
touching this pit causes hero to fall, level to
close, leading to blob dungeon.

Blob Dungeon
starts in an empty square room, the landing room.
in the landing room, the center area is empty,
and this is where hero spawns. there is no exit.
there is a small blob child NPC that will give
link the map, if link talks to the NPC. NPC is
invincible otherwise.

build path to hub room. (this is where we can load
the blob hub room with vendors, etc..)
build path to exit room. (we can have custom blob
exit room data here too)
add rooms, connect with secrets x2.
blob dungeons should be small and easy, without
miniboss or boss - like training wheels dungeon.












Separate Blob and Forest Dungeons

* the blob dungeon uses the town sheet *

create blob dungeon pit object - this will go on town level.
if hero collides with this obj, he falls into the blob dungeon.
this dungeon builds a critical path to the exit, which
dumps hero back out at last overworld location (or just town level).
-this moves blobs into their own dungeon, without a miniboss or boss.


add an entrance to the blob dungeon (this is pit obj)
from the town level. we can also move some npcs from 
the town level to the farm level, as it seems very
lonely there as is.


DaBlobs
the blobs live in the underworld, literally underground
of the light world. the have an entire culture, men, women,
and children. but they all look the same. they have thier own
building architecture. as blob link, you are mistaken for the
fabled hero blob that is told of in prophecy that will save
the blob people. this gives blob link an entire side plot
that doesn't touch the main plot.

Blob world
this is actually a series of rooms like a dungeon, but without
a hub room or boss room, and the hero's critical path is OUT
of the dungeon TO THE EXIT ROOM. this returns link to the overworld
map screen. in this blob dungeon city, there are rooms with buildings,
commerce, life. the blobs basically live in an underground dungeon.

as human link, the blobs will just ignore you with random dismissive
dialog. if you attack a NPC, the game spawns blob actors at all NPC
locations, then removes the NPCs - the end result being that the blobs
pickup swords and defend themselves from the evil human who attacked them.
we can also model this change using a boolean so future rooms spawn
blob enemies instead of NPCs.

as blob link, NPCs respond normally and all vendors are unlocked.
there is a spot reserved for the blob's sidequest in the hero's inventory.

How do we leave blob world?
the exit to the blob world is marked on the map, which the hero
gets from a helpful child blob in the room where hero's spawns into
blob dungeon. this is like a first peace offerring to tell player
that maybe they don't need to attack the blobs.









Polish / Bugs

*if a tree is burning, we can't destroy it
*because we only check for trees, and not burning trees too..



*we shouldn't be adding an offset to the camera
when we center to a dungeon room. this causes column
rooms to be displayed not centered IN GAME. but,
they displayed 'centered' in teh editor - which doesnt
matter at all!!!!




Refactoring

functions_level.buildPosition should be level.buildPosition.
same with fun_level.dungeonTrack... lol

level.id.Forest_Dungeon = id.Dungeon_Forest.
id.Forest_Entrance = id.Entrance_Forest.
fix these naming conventions.











Town++
we are going to rebuild the town level completely..
completely! with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens, add chickens. hitting a chicken should
make it cluck, of course.









TITLE SCREEN + TEST AI
*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.





Colliseum +++
extend colliseum with additional BAT (mountain) challenges.
add more miniboss + boss challenges.
add more standard enemy challenges.
add *colliseum unique* creature challenges.







add to forest dungeon:
eye statue - doesn't attack, can be picked up like turtle. 
doesnt move. hand placed.

floating sm eye - randomly floats around, explodes if near hero,
hand placed.





release polished 0.75... 




for now, all actors are using the same hitbox.
the hero's hitbox. so some enemies are really hard to
hit, because visually it looks like they are bigger
than their hitbox says they are in-game.



nasty system related work, ugh...
projectiles++
projectiles should be cast based on the caster's collision rec.
spawn() should account for collision rec and always spawn projectile
in a position that isn't overlapping caster's hitBox. this allows bosses
to spawn projectiles, since their collision rec isn't the same size
as heros, and we're basing all our projectile spawns off hero's hitbox.
this is a pretty important change.
