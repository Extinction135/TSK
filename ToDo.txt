REMAKE ROADMAP
- things have changed dramatically, since we've done so much.






Playtesting Bugs

purchased bow, left level, bow was gone.

upon dying, loadout is reset. dont do that.

the summary screen resets it's values to 0 after
first run, but upon second run those values dont
increase to show player progress. either the summ
screen is messed up or the dungeon record is not
being updated for the dungeon playthrough.

barrels should have explosion/destruction noise
they have null sfx
