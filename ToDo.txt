Today:














Inds++

we need BIG trees back in the game. add these to house test level.
done and done. house level is looking much better.


to rebuild levels, we need dungeon entrances.
to rebuild dungeons, we need roomdata. otherwise they should be empty.





Rebuild Level and Room Data

all level and room data that looks and plays well from prev version.



Levels++

add boat objects to the int widgets - barrels, etc.....
add boat objs to boat ind widgets
build ship at sea base level




relink level data to game. dungeon data can remain empty for now.
dungeons should build with empty rooms.



Indestructible Objs++

hero should have interaction rec with main exit object, taking
them outside the dungeon.



Mountain Dungeon Climb

wind pushes the player while they are trying to climb the mountain to the dungeon
entrance. the wind is an obj, with animated action lines, so the player can 'see' the
wind and it coming towards them - allowing them to dodge.


























Burned Grass

we need burned grass sprites. when grass burns, it becomes this
obj, which randomly chooses it's burned grass sprite frame. this is
darker brown short grass on normal ground.




Stop Fire Spell

this is a fire spell that kills all ground fires in the room.
simply calls Kill() on them all. this allows for control of
fire spreading, if we dont want something to burn, for example.





















Anti-Wind Item - Gravity Boots

we need to way to remove hero from wind pushing routines.
this can be using an item, making items useful besides the ring.
theres so much to do there.

these need to be boots. increases friction immensely.
but also increases magnitude to max value in moving direction.
this should negate the effects of wind, while allowing the user
to move very slowly. we can slow the walk anim down too.
this can be done for the hero in his update routine, which
has processed after the collisions, which it actually shouldn't.
it ishould process before, that way we can alter the magnitude / newPos * currPos
using the boots, then collisions can resolve, bypassing wind entirely.




Wind in Levels

wind should occasionally blow thru overworld levels
this is a bombos like wind sweep across the entire screen in a direction.
hero would be pushed. all pushable things would be pushed. 
this would also be a global spell cast.


Wind Polish

wind should interact specially with some objects, for example
leaves should fly out from trees that haven't been burned/stumps.
leaves can fly out of bushes too, just much less of them.
tall grass can alternate it's frame randomly, as if the wind was
tickling the grass as it passed by. 
it's a very environmental thing, but adds life.




















Spells - round 2

spell to cast gusts of wind away from the caster all directions.
spell to cast wind like bombos across screen globally.



Wind spells

repel: wind pros from casters center out, constantly across frames.

fly: pushes caster in facing direction each frame, in flying state.

mass move: pushes all objs, actors, and pros in room in given direction.

control wind: sets the level's wind direction, intensity, and frequency.

tornado: spawns a tornado roomObj. (fire, ice, explosive, electrical tornados too)...

****wind should work in water as well*****










Pros++

projectiles MUST check collisions against indestructibles,
and inds must kill() colliding pros. otherwise, arrows just hand
in the air against inds, waiting for something to collide with them.
which is weird.





Moar Optimizations!

boat floor objs need to be actual floor objs.
when we add them, we should be adding them from
the floors pool. cut grass and small grass, and
dirt tiles can all be floor objects, reducing the
strain on interactive obj pool more. these floor
objects are not actually interactive either.
we don't use floor objs in field levels, and thats
a waste of a useful budget for displaying certain
types of game objects that fields def do need.








Environmental Spell Bug

there is a state coming up soon where two environmental
spells may be cast against each other. this cannot happen
simply because the pools cant handle that. so, instead, we
need to have a environmental spell boolean that protects
against this dual-env spell cast state.





Explosive/Fire spells
Circle of Fire - creates groundfire around the caster in circle, across frames, continuously.
Fire Rain - red rain falls, creating ground fires where ever they touch (environmental fx).


Ice Spells

hail - large snowball objs fall, causing level 1 destruction,
creating icetiles where ball hitbox overlaps, mostly single ice tiles.
this is diff pattern than iceballs.
snowstorm - freezes all objects in level (frozen state), distrubuted
across frames, randomly freezing objs and placing icetiles
ice block wall - create wall of destructible ice blocks (only blocking, with ice
tiles underneath and around them).
ice block freeze all - freezes all actors with iceblocks that can be
frozen (non minibosses and bosses).



Electricity spells
ether - bolts from the sky (should have small clouds over them) (should
happen across frames too)
thunderstorm - clouds appear randomly, spawning bolts down
*levels should spawn clouds too - can 'rain' regrowing objects,
plus this adds depth. they can rain lightning, fire, ice, etc..
think of them as magic or projectile factories that interfere with
the player...

new ether
this just sequentially does the bolts, not all at once, and also
randomly spawns bolts around the caster (but not touching).
THERE SHOULD BE CLOUDS!







Quake Magic Medallion

how is this different than ether, in-game? ether kills
all, quake destroys everything that isn't flying. this
causes des level 2 to all objects and enemies who have
compMove.grounded set to false, except hero.
this simply shakes the camera for it's effect.

Summon spells

skeletons - actors that cannot be killed (self-rez from extended hit state).
summons 1, 4, or 16 or them.
bat summons are already done, more or less.

Comet Medallion

meteor/comet (single big / many small) falls from sky, smashing into ground,
leaving crater objects and explosions. this is the 4th medallion, meteor.

SpellBook++

need a widget / window that displays in the spell
screen that matches options widgets dimensions.
should simply contain text that explains what magic
is and how it's used. for example, WIND counters.








Ice Tile Melting++

fire melting ice is good, but it needs polish.
when we melt ice, we should create a wet spot particle,
which lasts for 200 or so frames, and helps to ease 
the ice tiles transition out of the world, since it
just dissappears right now.














BURN HOUSES

as in, have burned versions of each house obj that randomly
smoke and rarely collapse (like roofs randomly collapsing).
this should apply to a certain set of objects only.
consider making these objects in their own pool, because they
handle interactions and can be blocking / non-blocking.
indestructible objs ONLY BLOCK, and NEVER INTERACT.

all these house objs are on thier own sheet btw...









Fire Tornado
should be able to cast a fire tornado. this is obtained from fire tornado island,
by solving the puzzle and defeating the fire tornado destroying the land. this is done
by changing the wind direction to force the tornado over water, which extingushes the
fire and settles the tornado down. this unlocks the fire tornado magic somehow.
*weathervane - hitting the weathervane changes the direction of the wind. this allows
link to move the fire toronado out to sea and off the level. once this is done, the 
fire tornado magic is unlocked - or something else. i dunno.






LEVEL WIND



The Kusanagi Sword
this sword creates gusts of wind, which push objects
actors and projectiles (specifically ground fires).
this sword is used in a challenge where link must
push fire across a field to kill a rival warlod, via
the kusanagi legend in japan. alsoknown as the sword 
of gathering clouds.













Grass++
cut grass should grow into tall grass if near coastlines,
or filled ditches.









Big Magic Container + Frozen Smashing Damage Bonus

implement the hammer + ice bonus damage, plus the big magic
refill loot spawn. this is a special call in functions_loot,
specially made for hammers destroying iceblocks with actor or
object refs! with this check, we always spawn a big magic container.
which means, we need a big magic container.. lol..

rip this from lttps sprites.















comet magic

bombos should make non-hero actors explode via explosions
simultaneously, along with bomb circle around link.

quake shakes the screen and deals level 2 damage to everything
in the level. so it's very powerful. BUT flying objects and actors
are completely immune to it. this also means we need to write a
camera shake routine like we did in th.







Default Dungeon

the default dungeon sheet is the one we use for all
overworld / field level dungeon objects. this means
this 'dungeon' has a green grassy floor.

the pit teeth default to brown, which is part of the default
sheet. this default sheet should be thought of as the 'world' 
dungeon sheet - these pits will appear on the overworld against the
expected green bkg color. so the default pit teeth need to be green,
leading into brown as they go down into the ground. 






Coliseum++
we need 'windows' that look into the coliseum,
like the overworld sprite depicts. plus, I don't like
how the coliseum level is unbalanced and to the right.
instead, the coliseum - and all subsequent coliseums -
will be entrance centered to level, north of spawn.
this 'presents' the level much better, because coliseums
have no required puzzle for entry.

a window is a 3x4 obj, with baked in bkg.
so this saves us a lot of roomObjs.



Coliseum++++
we also need to have the large skulls be a 2nd object
that can sit on the ground, indestructible. this way
we can decorate the shadow coliseum appropriately.
we should add this skull detail to the overworld map as
well.





 





Water++

*we could have animated floating lily pads, much like the animated
flowers that sit over the grass levels. this would add some decoration
to the otherwise bland sea water.

*need to make boat anchor object - this is already in common objs,
and can be used to further decorate piers.






Implement Cane of Somara (or whatever)
this is the cane that creates blocks that are pushable.
this makes it MUCH easier to get thru dungeons, as many
rooms rely on floor switches, which link can simply
create a block over. if a block is created ontop of
a blocking roomObject, the block ...






Tall Coastlines
there is a problem with the tall coastline objs - we should be
able to dig over them, but doing so will remove the entire obj,
leaving a 16x16 ditch, instad of a 16x32 ditch to match the coastline
objs size. the green bkg will show, instead of water, breaking 
immersion. they are immune to digs for now. the solution is to 
break them up into two 16x16 objects, replace them in level,
then allow digging on the top object that transitions to land..
this trans should be based on the dirtcolor, not green, because
water doesn't transition directly to grass on islands. 
-for now tall coastlines are immune to dig-






Bag of Seeds

this simply allows link to place a bush stump, for now.
digging ditches + water tiles + bush stumps = farming.
this is next to magic mirror.

this forms the foundation of farming in the game.

when we click on the bag of beans, we should get a smaller
UI popup that lets us choose what type of seed we want.
for now, we only have bush seeds. these seeds grow bushes,
when planted next to a water source (coastline, water, filled ditch).
once the bush "grows", if its cut, it will leave a stump and
that sequence handles itself.

The Friendly Plant Seymor

-special seed, when planted, spawns a large plant that bites
any enemies near it, dealing them damage, while ignoring link.
this makes it a strategic weapon. these seeds should be limited,
unlike the infinite number of bush seeds link has.
this plant essentially dupes the tentacle actor's functionality.
-after taking a certain amount of damage, the plant dies, so it
cant block and attack in an invincible way. this means it's an actor.
when this plant grows, it spawns the actor and removes itself.

Vine To The Sky

-special seed obtained from fisherman. when planted at cloud
location will spawn a big vine into the sky that link can interact
with. for now this is just a dialog asking if player wants to climb vine,
and if so, then we load the 1st cloud level. later on, link should
be able to actually climb the vine, just like a mountain wall, but the
whole vine is a climbable foothold object. once link collides with a
light obj in the 'clouds', we load the cloud level, or we load the overworld
with link on a cloud location - which allows for much faster traversal
up the clouds later! awesome.

*requires two cloud levels, so we have to touch level data and XML>CS pipeline











Summary Screen++

Summary Screen is not properly displaying player data,
or info about any dungeon record playthrough.

dungeon records should be reset upon dungeon build.
we should be adding the dungeon data properly upon
completion too.





Display Playtime (in inventory?) keep this offscreen.

need to add timespan to playerdata to track playtime,
so we ca display it under repo name on right.
