Today:




Editor++

added mountain widget object + mountain level id
values for mountain entrance and dungeon. updated
fun_texture to set mountain texture based on level.id.
fixed a minor bug where initial editor menu display
state wasn't properly set into forest state.
lots of playtesting.












Mountain Walls

add mountain objects to mountain widget. 
these objects are the mountain wall object and the foothold
object. we should make the mountain wall object
very large, and the foot hold objects should be 16x16.
this way we get an optimization in roomObjs (mountain walls)
because they will be taking up the most space visually.

we need to create the mountain entrance level.
we dont need to have the dungeon entrance just yet,
lets focus on climbing for now.
































**we have nothing for the 'entrance' obj for the
town sheet. this could be the big weather vane
with the duck from kakariko village, but that's
just decorative 'throwback' and isn't really useful..



clear town level - we are going to rebuild it 
completely, with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens.

create town sheet. 
update game so town level loads town sheet.
move gates and building objects out from shared
area and into unique section, just for town.
update their animFrames!





*exiting the forest dungeon placed link at colliseum.
it's likely we're not checking to see if link is exiting
a level of id.type dungeon.








Mountain Level
should be able to climb up certain rock walls, denoted with small
footholds. hold A to climb. rockwalls normally push link down (faking
gravity), but while in climbing state the push is ignored. this allows
link to literally climb up the mountain. he can't use any items while,
climbing so link has to dodge enemies until he can get to a landing to
take care of them.

the 1st field level is the basecamp and start of the mountain.
the 2nd field level is the major climbing level, and contains the
entrance to the mountain dungeon.
the 3rd field level is the summit, and contains summit related things. ???
the mountain dungeon entrance is NOT on the summit, because
it would be difficult and time consuming to climb all the way back
up when player has died in the dungeon. at the summit we could
have an overlook - which creates a screen with nice concept art and music.
like the player was looking at hyrule from atop a mountain.







Screens + ScreenManager
migrate screens to be GLOBAL. they will still inherit
from base class of screen, but this way we get to keep
the last selected menuItem, etc... 







*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.
