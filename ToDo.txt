Gif Capture process:
	run game in release mode
	run LiceCap, expand capture area past program window about 10 pixels on each side
	record at 30fps, open in photoshop and crop the frame down to just the game view (minus window title)
	reduce image size by half, down to original size so pixels are 1:1 ratio
	save as PSD master, then begin cutting out sections/edits
	the default time per frame (set by licecap) is perfect, do not change this
	save for web ->  GIF 32 Dithered, filesize should be under 3mb, loop forever
	test in browser to ensure proper fps
adding music:
	files are saved as .ogg and added to content pipeline, built on high quality.
	keep these files stereo, but at 22k.
adding sound effects:
	sound effects should be compressed down to 22K sample rate, mono, 16bit
VS shortcuts
	CTRL + M, O = collapse functions/regions	
new gif: 50% nearest neighbor, 32 dithered
adding a cheat:
	add value to MenuItemType enum (cheat starts as a selectable menu item)
	update MenuItem.SetType() to set cheat menuItem descriptions, titles, and initial frame.
	add menuItem to Cheat Screen.
	link neighbors, add effect, add check to SetCheatMenuItems(), playtest.
Adding GameObjs:
	make enum defs, make animFrames,
	set objType paths, add to env obj widget
	playtest in field.

v0.8 goals

- the "shadow system"
every actor has a shadow, based on the actor size and flying state.
larger actor = large shadow, flying actor = smaller shadow (due to height off ground)
every object has a shadow, based on the obj type, size, and state.
these shadows maybe visible or not. these shadows should track to the
objects/actors each frame, AFTER the compMove component has finished processing.
these shadows are sprites that are added to actors and gameobj classes.
this will likely be part of pool, possibly just prior to drawing to ensure
they are always aligned to their obj/actor (altho this does pollute Draw)..

- houses, includes buildings, beds, interior objs

- Non-room repeating Dungeon, additional rooms
- Flying Dungeon Enemy, Minor Overworld Enemies
- Blob AI improvements - sword, arrow, bomb based on weapon / item loadout 
- blob loadouts could be randomized when room is built()

- EndlessForest Demo (shows off gameplay, complete on it's own, camera tracks to hero).
- this is randomly placed bushes / trees / grass + ANY enemy type
- room rec tracks to hero, expanded room rec cleans up anything that doesn't touch it
- as room moves, *generate random stuff just OUTSIDE of room rec*
- this means, as hero moves he is always 'finding' new stuff, even if he doubles back
- npc outside endless forest dialog = "once you go in, there's no way out..."
- later on implement magic mirror, which returns hero to overworld screen

- LIGHT WORLD & DARK WORLD
- implement enumFields for building rooms (big optimization)

- create 'boat' level, with boat captain, who has dialog with link
- offers to take link to a variety of locations, using vendor screen
- only available location is water temple, for low gold price (since link 'hires' crew)
- this level is the boat obj + a dungeon entrance obj + a bunch of water tiles (maybe a small island)
- links path is to/from the boat to the dungeon entrance

- water temple / swamp dungeon: 
	build crit path to hub, crit path to key, crit path to boss, 
	*crit path to water switch (pullable lever)
	*place water switch randomly in room/hub room
	water pullable lever flips high/low water level boolean
	when rooms are built they build high or low water levels, 
	low water levels prevent hero from passing thru rooms 
	there are low water levels in rooms along the key or boss crit path.
	hero must flip switch to access key or boss rooms, or not.
	boss is tentacles squid
	
- mountain dungeon (diff enemies, boss, dungeon sprites - but same rooms)

- room keys - these only work for the room and only unlock 1 door, and
these rooms turn all their doors into locked doors upon close, similar to puzzled rooms
link doesn't put them into inventory, he literally picks them up and takes
them to the door to unlock it. this is super mario style key gameplay.
if link's heldObj == small key, then link's interaction with locked door makes it open.
and heldObj is released().











Friday
	- record playthrus and examples of gameplay, post. 
	- release v0.72.
	- update readme.

	- create archive releases for v0.1 - v0.7. (fork, revert, release, delete.)
	- later, we can compare gameplay across versions.
	- note this is only for Dx version. UWP version tracking should start with v0.7.
	- these version archives should remain local, outside of repo folder.
	- *we should be able to record via the a20s just fine, via obs.
	
	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	



TODAY:





Shovel Projectile 

fixed a bug where hero coudldn't equip the shovel.
added ObjType ProjectileShovel.
added sprite for shovel projectile.
added animFrame, gameObj.type def.

added path for shovel pro into pro functions,
handling behavior just like sword.
added shovel pro into battle.damage(), causing
1 damage (like sword) but only pushing with
a force of 3 (instead of sword's 6), so
there is a cost to using the shovel instead of 
the sword - the enemies get pushed far less.

in the future, we'll also add in the swords 
special attack and a full health projectile
just like LttP, so there will be much more
value to using the sword for combat vs shovel.
but right now, the shovel is a A/B tier weapon.
with fireballs + arrows being S tier, obvs.

appended shovel into sword's interaction
routines, so shovel can destroy everything 
sword can, as well as create sparkles upon hit.

updated sword and shovel hits on blocking objs to
center the sparkle particle to the hit obj.
added shovel into SetRotation(), which properly
flips the sprite to align to the actor's hand.
lots of playtesting, working very well.

this completes the implementation of the
battle / interactive side of shovel.












Ditches and The Ditch System


the shovel projectile DOESNT create trenches. only hero creates trenches.
that is a separate method, the Dig() method, that is called
only when the actor first uses the shovel. no debris is created by shovel pro!
*consider that actors may need interaction points*
*needed if actors want to pickup or dig, and it would be nice to see that
with more advanced enemies later on*



migrate hero's interaction rec and interaction rec functions into actor class.




*we could also consolidate gameobj_dungeon and gameobj_world into gameobj class.
while the compartmentalization is organized, its easier to just
recall the methods exist under the fun_gameObj class than split them between 3.






DIGGING

Dig(Actor Actor) method: place a trench obj aligned to 16x16 px grid in room.
the trench obj's position is based on the actor's pos and facing direction.
we apply a slight offset to the center of the sprite pos to get a good dig pos,
then align that to a 16x16 grid, so all trenches will line up.

certain objects reject the Dig method tho, objects that we don't want
the hero to be able to destroy, like walls. if we can DIG successfully,
then create a debris explosion and place the META trench obj in the room.

TRENCH SYSTEM

the initial trench obj placed is a temp obj with a 20x20 collision rec.
on it's first frame, it checks to see what trench objs overlap it.
using the list of overlapping trenches nearby, sort to a NSEW boolean list.
(this is done by comparing new trench sprite pos to neighbor sprite pos.)
then we can switch the type of the trench just placed to 'fit' into
it's neighboring trenches. N+S = vertical. E+W = horizontal.
N+(E/W) etc = corner trench. N+S+E+W = quad trench. we only need 3 trench sprites. lol.
this makes it easy to propagate water thru them too, as we would then
have low, med, filled sprite versions of the trench.

we will also need 'end caps' that connect to straight pieces.
and trenches that are just single holes in the ground.







destroying a coastline is the first step to creating a water channel.

	- ditch objs have 16x16 collrec, and look like 'deep dirt', a layer under ground.
	- the same way fire spreads (using interactive frame), we can spread water tiles
	- water tiles expand for one frame and make ditch tiles water tiles if they touch
	- then we need to implement cascading effect: low, med, high water tiles.
	- high > med > low > ditch is the spreading routine.
	- at this point link should be able to construct water channels
	



* add windmill obj that animates if a filled trench obj touches it
in the right neighboring tile.


**** playtest as much as you can thursday ****








Swimming++
while in the water, pressing X should Push() things infront of you.
pressing Y should Dive(). this gives hero some non lethal attack
to get enemies in the water away from him.






Boomerang++
*boomerang should only create attention particles upon hit if
it's traveling away from hero. if it's returning to hero (it's lifecounter)
then it shouldn't create ANY attention particles. this fixes
the visual bug where it can create a ton of pops when hitting
objs from certain angles / directions.













Metal Gear ++

if you're carrying an obj and press B while not moving, link
should squat down and the heldObj should sort mostly over his head,
and he should flip the actor.hidden boolean. then update functions_AI
to check the actor.hidden boolean instead of the actor.underwater
boolean. then update the underwater rountines to set the actor.hidden
boolean to true when actor dives underwater. the net effect of these
changes is that the hero will be able to hide underwater, underwater
while carrying an obj, or on land while carrying an obj. 
being able to hide on land while carrying an obj is more metal gear
than being able to dive while holding an obj. lol.










Boss & Miniboss

*we have big eye boss, with hit state and idle blink,
so we *could* make him the boss of the dungeon, and move big blob
into the hub as a miniBoss, which would be awesome.

the eye boss should spawn throw bombs towards hero with great force.
while also defensively moving away from hero. also, boss should be
invincible to bombs, because that's his main weapon, and we wouldn't 
want him killing himself. he should also have alot of health.
