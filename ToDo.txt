Today:



BedBugs

fixed a bug where beds were displaying
the improper debris sprite, which was
due to the debris object never setting
it's cellSize back to 16x16, and since
the bed was 16x32, the animFrame pointed
to the wrong sprite - the closed building
door sprite, lol.










Release 0.74 - The Colliseum

the major addition 0.74 brings is The
Colliseum, a place where link can purchase
challenges. A challenge is a set of enemies,
with a reward. If link defeats all the
enemies, then he gets the reward. Otherwise,
link dies, is kicked out of the colliseum to
the overworld screen, and has to buy the
challenge again. for now, there are 3
challenges that are all pretty crazy and fun.

there's also been a ton of smaller 
improvements to the overall game.











Part1

record playthrough using OBS. dump this raw
video file as private video to youtube.

record gifs using licecap over obs recording.
this way we have more control over the filesize, and
the framing of the content we want to highlight.

record several gifs to edit together for 0.74.
post 0.74 gif and video to readme.

export install version of game for Dx.
export appx package of game for UWP.
upload to dropbox, add links back to readme.

delete versions page entirely.






Part2

create the gameplay page in the repo, and start
filling it with examples of gameplay gifs (with text notes):

moving & dashing
attacking, using items, inventory
colliseum fighting
grass fires + burning objects
swimming, swim dashing 
pickup, throw, dash carry
sneaking, swimming underwater
buildings, roofs, destruction
Vendors + NPCs
minibosses + bosses
