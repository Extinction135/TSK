Today:







Miniboss : Armored Spider

spider miniboss: has 2 phases: armored and not armored.
starts off armored, using shovel, armor 'breaks' via
shatter soundfx and multiple rising smoke particles.
unarmored version moves faster and attacks more often.
and taunts and blinks. and smokes like other minis.

armored
frame 1 flips horizontally for idle
frame 2 is hit and attack (bite).
frame 2 could also a secondary idle animation.

unarmored
frame 1 flips horizontally for idle
frame 2 is hit and attack (bite).

death
frame 1 is pre-death (hold here 5 frames)
frame 2 is dead state.

how do we switch from armored to unarmored
spiders? by setting the actor type upon the
armored spiders death, meaning the actor changes
into a different actor - meaning we need an
unarmored spider actor that is totally separate
from the armored version..

changed unarmored spiders hit to be an eyes
closed sprite, which flips horizontally causing
the spider to seem like he's about to fall over
(woozy or wobbly), which i think will play into
the hit effect well.

made the unarmored spiders death animation to 
be the wobbly hit animation for longer, plus a
final crumpled dead squished spider sprite.

added death routines for unarmored spider,
drops map and copies blackeye's death.

updated dungeon routines to spawn armored
spider in mountain dungeon hub room.

spider miniboss implements the fang weapon,
and then implements basic ai (no special
strategy here). the unique-ness is in the
initial presentation of the enemy: slow and
armored, invincible to the common attacks.
after 'discovering' how to hurt the boss,
he changes into the fast, easier to kill
version which is also more challenging.

armored spider should resist all damage except:
explosions, lightning, shovel. < done.
all other projectiles create 'clink' soundfx to
signal to player that their attack didn't damage
miniboss. < done. tested.

modified how actor 'invincibilities' are handled
in functions_battle, to be cleaner.

changed basic ai to be more aggressive in attack
against hero - specifically the probability of an
enemy attacking the hero went from 50/50 to 75%
chance, meaning it's more likely enemies will
bite and swing swords at hero.

removed wall statues from key rooms, because i want
the player to focus on the puzzle, not dodging arrows.

lots of playtesting to make sure armored spider is
implemented properly.

retuned the unarmored spider to actually be pretty
challenging to defeat because he's just insanely
aggressive - chases hero almost as fast as hero 
can dash / evade him. VERY happy with this miniboss!





Issue: in FinishHubRoom(), we assume the boss room
is connected to the hub room via north connection.
this is no longer true, as the mountain dungeon can
connect the boss room to ANY other room type, as it
builds a critical path FROM the hub to the boss room.
so, each time we build a room we need to check to see
if the boss door exists, and then we need to add
decorations if it does exist.

Fix: moved boss door decoration routines into method
fun_dungeon.Check_BossDoor(), which loops all roomObjs,
looking for Obj.type Dungeon_DoorBoss, then decorates
it. dungeon routines always attach boss door via north
connection, so we always know where to place the doormat.












repack beefy bat next to miniboss spider.
we have a nice 2 frame opening there.












batboss should spawn a bunch of bats + smoke
particles when he dies, because he's basically missing
a falling animation frame. OR YOU COULD JUST MAKE
MORE DEATH SPRITE ANIMATION FRAMES, LAZY ASS.
from attack frame, make 2 falling frames to final
dead on ground sprite.












armor can be broken using shovel or hammer.

HammerTime (sry, had2)
create and implement hammer weapon.
this is used to flatten some objects, & break armor.
it's a decent weapon too.
breaking armor should be noted in the flavor text.





SleepingBat
sleeping bat roomObject: uses the upside down
bat sprite from mountain's 31,0 frame. when hero
gets close enough, this obj becomes a bat projectile,
with a direction towards hero's last position.
this means bat doesn't track hero, so hero can move.
also, bat pro has randomness applied to it's spawn,
so it's very likely the bat will move unpredictably,
but it will at least be moving towards hero.

put sleeping bats on the mountain entrance level.
DO NOT put these objs in dungeon room data.



Bat World Enemy
bat world enemy: bat flys towards hero and bites
him. if bat creates a bite projectile, bat removes itself.
*the difference between world bat and beefy bat is that
beefy bat can bite multiple times and has 2 hp.



this complete implementation of mountain dungeon, so far.
- technially 0.75 is done at this point. -













POLISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for 0.75



exterior colliseum floors really do need to be lighter...




Enemy Items VENDOR
enemy items exist in the last slot of
each type - item, weapon, armor, equipment..
meaning hero can only hold one of them at a time.
the only place to get these items is from the enemy
items vendor, located outside the colliseum (for now).




rats and crabs should "bite", but turtles dont.
all types can be picked up and carried, but rats
and crabs will eventually bite link, causing link
to throw the creature and take 1 damage.









implement blob dungeon.
standard actor is blob.

Blob Dungeon + Overworld Pit

overworld pit is a non-blocking obj, 16x16,
that is placed somewhere in town level. hero
touching this pit causes hero to fall, level to
close, leading to blob dungeon.

Blob Dungeon
starts in an empty square room, the landing room.
in the landing room, the center area is empty,
and this is where hero spawns. there is no exit.
there is a small blob child NPC that will give
link the map, if link talks to the NPC. NPC is
invincible otherwise.

build path to hub room. (this is where we can load
the blob hub room with vendors, etc..)
build path to exit room. (we can have custom blob
exit room data here too)
add rooms, connect with secrets x2.
blob dungeons should be small and easy, without
miniboss or boss - like training wheels dungeon.












Separate Blob and Forest Dungeons

* the blob dungeon uses the town sheet *

create blob dungeon pit object - this will go on town level.
if hero collides with this obj, he falls into the blob dungeon.
this dungeon builds a critical path to the exit, which
dumps hero back out at last overworld location (or just town level).
-this moves blobs into their own dungeon, without a miniboss or boss.


add an entrance to the blob dungeon (this is pit obj)
from the town level. we can also move some npcs from 
the town level to the farm level, as it seems very
lonely there as is.


DaBlobs
the blobs live in the underworld, literally underground
of the light world. the have an entire culture, men, women,
and children. but they all look the same. they have thier own
building architecture. as blob link, you are mistaken for the
fabled hero blob that is told of in prophecy that will save
the blob people. this gives blob link an entire side plot
that doesn't touch the main plot.

Blob world
this is actually a series of rooms like a dungeon, but without
a hub room or boss room, and the hero's critical path is OUT
of the dungeon TO THE EXIT ROOM. this returns link to the overworld
map screen. in this blob dungeon city, there are rooms with buildings,
commerce, life. the blobs basically live in an underground dungeon.

as human link, the blobs will just ignore you with random dismissive
dialog. if you attack a NPC, the game spawns blob actors at all NPC
locations, then removes the NPCs - the end result being that the blobs
pickup swords and defend themselves from the evil human who attacked them.
we can also model this change using a boolean so future rooms spawn
blob enemies instead of NPCs.

as blob link, NPCs respond normally and all vendors are unlocked.
there is a spot reserved for the blob's sidequest in the hero's inventory.

How do we leave blob world?
the exit to the blob world is marked on the map, which the hero
gets from a helpful child blob in the room where hero's spawns into
blob dungeon. this is like a first peace offerring to tell player
that maybe they don't need to attack the blobs.









Polish / Bugs

*if a tree is burning, we can't destroy it
*because we only check for trees, and not burning trees too..



*we shouldn't be adding an offset to the camera
when we center to a dungeon room. this causes column
rooms to be displayed not centered IN GAME. but,
they displayed 'centered' in teh editor - which doesnt
matter at all!!!!




Refactoring

functions_level.buildPosition should be level.buildPosition.
same with fun_level.dungeonTrack... lol

level.id.Forest_Dungeon = id.Dungeon_Forest.
id.Forest_Entrance = id.Entrance_Forest.
fix these naming conventions.











Town++
we are going to rebuild the town level completely..
completely! with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens, add chickens. hitting a chicken should
make it cluck, of course.









TITLE SCREEN + TEST AI
*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.





Colliseum +++
extend colliseum with additional BAT (mountain) challenges.
add more miniboss + boss challenges.
add more standard enemy challenges.
add *colliseum unique* creature challenges.







add to forest dungeon:
eye statue - doesn't attack, can be picked up like turtle. 
doesnt move. hand placed.

floating sm eye - randomly floats around, explodes if near hero,
hand placed.





release polished 0.75... 




for now, all actors are using the same hitbox.
the hero's hitbox. so some enemies are really hard to
hit, because visually it looks like they are bigger
than their hitbox says they are in-game.



nasty system related work, ugh...
projectiles++
projectiles should be cast based on the caster's collision rec.
spawn() should account for collision rec and always spawn projectile
in a position that isn't overlapping caster's hitBox. this allows bosses
to spawn projectiles, since their collision rec isn't the same size
as heros, and we're basing all our projectile spawns off hero's hitbox.
this is a pretty important change.
