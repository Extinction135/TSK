Today:








Beefy Bats

* beefy bats dont properly face their moving direction.
their sprite facing direction is independent of their moving direction.
- this was a problem with their animation frames, which
was fixed. however, upon interacting with them a new bug was
discovered with beefy bats: since all ai controlled actors 
move diagonally, the diagonal movement is resolved to a cardinal
direction and all diagonal movement specifically resolves to
either left or right (not up or down). as a result, the beefy
bat sprite rarely displays his up or down animation - unless
he bite attacks or dashes north / south. this isn't the visual
process that I want. instead, we'll update the AI to set the
movement to a cardinal direction for beefy bats, instead of a 
diagonal direction - allowing the visual process to occur
the way I want it to.

^ done. it would appear a better solution would be to model
if an actor chases diagonally or cardinally using a boolean.
the current system specifically checks the actor.type, of
which there are some and will be many more. it would save time
and code later, but incurs an upfront cost of a quick system 
rewrite for actor ai chasing... seems like a good investment.

* instead of checking by actor type, we want to add a boolean
to actor class that controls how this actor chases or moves towards
the hero (diagonally or cardinally). moving diagonally is preferred,
but there are certain actors that require north/south movement
to properly display their animated sprites.. moving cardinally
was the original implementation for actors, until it was realized
that actors easily get stuck on blocks and never move around them
until hero does, leading a variety of exploits that made the ai
look really, really dumb. the fix was simply to make all actors
chase using diagonal movement, which allowed them to slide around
blocks (thanks physics system!), making them very challenging and
"smart".

^ done. notes from playtesting: we should only be spawning one 
beefy bat in dungeon rooms for spawn points. this may of already
been implemented - but anyway - we also need to increase how
often the beefy bat dashes towards hero - and increase his attack
probability to 100% - but we also need to decrease his visibility
radius to hero so he doesn't trigger until hero is much closer.
at that point, the bat is a very dangerous enemy.

to actually implement this without complicating the AI too much,
I decided to create an new ActorAI enum value for BeefyBat.
this will be a seperate ai path, much like miniboss or boss.

beefybat has a 90% chance to bite attack hero, instead of the
standard 75% chance. the new AI also returns every bat to a south
facing state after an idle dash event, so a hivemaind visual
is conveyed (they all face the same way, watching you). it's
creepy and effective and exactly what I want.

* bats should not be able to die from bite attacks, because it's
very likely other bats will be group attacking and kill each other
in this case. < done. this also improved the structure of Damage(),
creating sections for standard, miniboss, and boss regions.

the playtesting of beefybats has been successful - they now
have a unique and interesting 'personality' as an enemy type.













*we should spawn more than 1 mountain miniboss spider in the hub room.
maybe three...



* we should not be calling the fall sound from interaction with 
mountain wall. this should only be called if hero's state
changes into falling state from a non-falling state. and it
should only happen once. this means if hero is ever put into a
falling state, the sfx is handled automatically. this also
prevents a bug where the sound fx is spammed while hero falls
down a mountain wall.





Towns++
add a 2nd town level on the left of the map, below left town.
we can begin to split the NPCs apart between these two towns.
we also need to add a town on the right side of the map, outside
of the city gates. move some NPCs over there too.


Magic Mirror
this plays well into magic mirror: use it in a dungeon to return
to the exit (starting room). exiting dungeon takes us to field.
using magic mirror in field level takes hero to overworld screen.
it does not serve as a connection between worlds, because it has
been broken. the history of why it was broken can be explained.
*need sprite

























Swamp miniboss and boss (requires special room data for hub & boss)

miniboss: in water mouth
creates splash when transitioning from above/in water states.
while in water, actor is not blocking and can't be hit.
above water, the actor constantly 'chomps' his mouth, creating bite pros
randomly the actor decides to go underwater/above water.
randomly the actor choose a direction.
randomly the actor dashes.

boss A: ocotohead
randomly ducks in/out of water.
not harmable while in water.
bobs slightly while above water.
only moves while underwater.
creates splash when transitioning.
takes alot of damage, has no attack.
as his health gets lower, he moves
more erratically.

boss minions: tentacles
has above and below water states like head.
pops up, into idle (left 2 frames).
randomly attacks left/right with bites, using
wild swinging animation frames.
takes some damage, but not alot.

swamp boss room:
octohead + 4 tentacles.
when octohead gets below 10 health, he spawns 4 more tentacles.

*we need a watery hub room for swamp mini
*we need a watery boss room for swamp boss
*we need small tiles that the hero can stand on, above water (water lillies!)

*we need swamp dungeon to specifically load these mini & boss rooms.
**in fact, it would be good to have dungeons specifically load the hub
and boss rooms, so we dont have insane boss battles on ice.

we need to 'texture id' each room to a dungeon type using an enum, in xml data.
then loop over the hub rooms, looking for forest id enum, then build it.
we could even collect a list of hub rooms with forest id enum,
and randomly choose one, allowing for variation. we could even
place forest specific objects in these rooms, because we know they
will always be built in the forest sheet (so we dont have two level
sheets on screen at once).

this could be the way to set the level's texture as well.
if the room has a dungeon type enum, then we know what texture that
room requires to be displayed correctly. when we load the room,
we could simply set the texture based on the room's texture enum.

*this removes the need for SetTexture() to exist, as we load/set
the texture based on the texture enum found in xml data, instead.

some rooms would have the texture enum id of any, corresponding to
any of the texture sheets. in this case, we would base the texture
off of the level id.






















swamp entrance level design
-must swim UNDERWATER under objects to gain access to dungeon entrance.
-need these water objects to swim under too
-need to update underwater swimming to allow for passing through
certain objects (those created above)...


spikeblocks? swim under. indestructible. immobile.
lily pads? stand on top of, with watery feet.
marsh grass = impassable, but burnable.








forest entrance level design
-must grow or destroy foilage to enter dungeon?
-or maybe we keep this as the gimmick for darkworld dungeon.


Mountain Sprites
add black pixels to the corners of the mountain wall sprites.
this will make the rooms appear rounded, which further visually
separates them. 




Colliseum Entrance Obj++
the colliseum entrance obj should just be a wide black entrance,
like the center sprite. we dupe that for a total of 3, so we have
a massive entrance. then put those skull pillars on the side. why?
to match the entrance/exit sizes between the colliseum levels.
the exit from the interior is pretty wide, so the entrance
should be wide as well.















My Chickens!
now that we have posts, we can make this sidequest.
this is an NPC with an expanding hitBox check for 4 chickens
nearby. surrounding the NPC is the posts, which form a chicken
pen. link has to pickup and deliver the 4 chickens to the pen,
then he gets the reward.























Polish + Fixes

explosions should push roomObjects that they touch.
that are moveable. that dont get destroyed?
are explosions pushing objects?

add a 'clean room' button - removes all roomObjs
not of group wall or door. thats it.
leaves us with a blank room with walls, doors,
statues, and floors.
add this button to a new widget.. somewhere..


rats and crabs should "bite", but turtles dont.
all types can be picked up and carried, but rats
and crabs will eventually bite link, causing link
to throw the creature and take 1 damage.


it would be nice to show the currently selected objects
important parameters, like moveable, grounded, etc..
we could put this info next to the object in the objTools
widget, if we extende the widget.


footholds were pushed off the mountain wall.
i assume a frame of interaction happened prior to
the roomObj types being updated. 
*when we reset the pool, stopMovement() on all objs too.








TITLE SCREEN + TEST AI

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.




add to forest dungeon:
eye statue - doesn't attack, can be picked up like turtle. 
doesnt move. hand placed.

floating sm eye - randomly floats around, explodes if near hero,
hand placed.



FIX PROJECTILE SPAWN SYSTEM PLS K THX BAI

for now, all actors are using the same hitbox.
the hero's hitbox. so some enemies are really hard to
hit, because visually it looks like they are bigger
than their hitbox says they are in-game. this has been
fine so far, but we want MORE CONTROL over hitboxes...
-related to-
projectiles++
projectiles should be cast based on the caster's collision rec.
spawn() should account for collision rec and always spawn projectile
in a position that isn't overlapping caster's hitBox. this allows bosses
to spawn projectiles, since their collision rec isn't the same size
as heros, and we're basing all our projectile spawns off hero's hitbox.
this is a pretty important change.
