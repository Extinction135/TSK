Default Loadout

default load out should be:
sword, boomerang, cloth. that's it. reset sets
this right, so this is loadout widget not getting
updated? aha! the updateLoadout() method for
the loadout widget was referencing the hero's loadout
from pool, which wasn't necessarily sync'd to playerdata.
playerdata being the global instance, much more important
that the local hero item, weapon, etc... that each actor
uses to model their equiped item, weapon, etc... 

widgetloadout.UpdateLoadout(); needs to be called when
the overworld screen is opened(), and we need to make sure
upon hero death with a fairy bottle that hero's loadout isnt
being reset or lost. if hero actually dies, then summary
screen pops and the loadout doesnt matter at all.
we call the update loadout() to sync playerdata to hero data,
setting the hero's actual item, weapon, armor, equipment.

default loadout working. improved exit dialog.
tested entering game, exiting game from inventory menu.














upon title reload, the widget/window is already
open. it should reset itself.










Dungeon Record

we no longer need beatDungeon in dungeon record.
we flip the story booleans true upon boss death
in specific dungeon room.










ScreenManager.ExitAndLoad(Screens.Overworld_ShadowKing);







Display Playtime (in inventory?) keep this offscreen.

need to add timespan to playerdata to track playtime,
so we ca display it under repo name on right.








Big Magic Container + Frozen Smashing Damage Bonus

implement the hammer + ice bonus damage, plus the big magic
refill loot spawn. this is a special call in functions_loot,
specially made for hammers destroying iceblocks with actor or
object refs! with this check, we always spawn a big magic container.
which means, we need a big magic container.. lol..

rip this from lttps sprites.





Bombos++

we can improve bombos, if we simply change the explosion
placements around link. more or less, but it doesn't need
to be in a square pattern. plus, it would be nice to
see these explosions happen sequentially around hero, so
use a counter to meter out which explosions are placed where.
we can even have some kind of custom explosion particle over
hero when he casts this, showing the player that bombos is pushing
outwards from them, showing aoe effects.




Lightning Bolts++

lightning bolts should have an initial ground blast,
because they are hitting the ground, not the air.
we can also have a tapered lightning bolt at the top that
fades out, limiting the bolt to 5 + 1 particles,
plus 1 explosion projectile, per enemy, for a total of
7 * actor/obj enemy count.





comet magic

bombos should make non-hero actors explode via explosions
simultaneously, along with bomb circle around link.

quake shakes the screen and deals level 2 damage to everything
in the level. so it's very powerful. BUT flying objects and actors
are completely immune to it. this also means we need to write a
camera shake routine like we did in th.



Enemy MAgic

we need a blank generic magic medallion to model random enemy
magic, so we dont waste alot of space in the main sheet on these.
easy - and then we can have a specific slot in the UI for enemy
magic under misc.







Default Dungeon

the default dungeon sheet is the one we use for all
overworld / field level dungeon objects. this means
this 'dungeon' has a green grassy floor.

the pit teeth default to brown, which is part of the default
sheet. this default sheet should be thought of as the 'world' 
dungeon sheet - these pits will appear on the overworld against the
expected green bkg color. so the default pit teeth need to be green,
leading into brown as they go down into the ground. 






Coliseum++
we need 'windows' that look into the coliseum,
like the overworld sprite depicts. plus, I don't like
how the coliseum level is unbalanced and to the right.
instead, the coliseum - and all subsequent coliseums -
will be entrance centered to level, north of spawn.
this 'presents' the level much better, because coliseums
have no required puzzle for entry.

a window is a 3x4 obj, with baked in bkg.
so this saves us a lot of roomObjs.



Coliseum++++
we also need to have the large skulls be a 2nd object
that can sit on the ground, indestructible. this way
we can decorate the shadow coliseum appropriately.
we should add this skull detail to the overworld map as
well.





Grass++
cut grass should grow into tall grass if near coastlines,
or filled ditches. 





Water++

*we could have animated floating lily pads, much like the animated
flowers that sit over the grass levels. this would add some decoration
to the otherwise bland sea water.

*need to make boat anchor object - this is already in common objs,
and can be used to further decorate piers.






Implement Cane of Somara (or whatever)
this is the cane that creates blocks that are pushable.
this makes it MUCH easier to get thru dungeons, as many
rooms rely on floor switches, which link can simply
create a block over. if a block is created ontop of
a blocking roomObject, the block ...






Tall Coastlines
there is a problem with the tall coastline objs - we should be
able to dig over them, but doing so will remove the entire obj,
leaving a 16x16 ditch, instad of a 16x32 ditch to match the coastline
objs size. the green bkg will show, instead of water, breaking 
immersion. they are immune to digs for now. the solution is to 
break them up into two 16x16 objects, replace them in level,
then allow digging on the top object that transitions to land..
this trans should be based on the dirtcolor, not green, because
water doesn't transition directly to grass on islands. 
-for now tall coastlines are immune to dig-






Bag of Seeds

this simply allows link to place a bush stump, for now.
digging ditches + water tiles + bush stumps = farming.
this is next to magic mirror.

this forms the foundation of farming in the game.

when we click on the bag of beans, we should get a smaller
UI popup that lets us choose what type of seed we want.
for now, we only have bush seeds. these seeds grow bushes,
when planted next to a water source (coastline, water, filled ditch).
once the bush "grows", if its cut, it will leave a stump and
that sequence handles itself.

The Friendly Plant Seymor

-special seed, when planted, spawns a large plant that bites
any enemies near it, dealing them damage, while ignoring link.
this makes it a strategic weapon. these seeds should be limited,
unlike the infinite number of bush seeds link has.
this plant essentially dupes the tentacle actor's functionality.
-after taking a certain amount of damage, the plant dies, so it
cant block and attack in an invincible way. this means it's an actor.
when this plant grows, it spawns the actor and removes itself.

Vine To The Sky

-special seed obtained from fisherman. when planted at cloud
location will spawn a big vine into the sky that link can interact
with. for now this is just a dialog asking if player wants to climb vine,
and if so, then we load the 1st cloud level. later on, link should
be able to actually climb the vine, just like a mountain wall, but the
whole vine is a climbable foothold object. once link collides with a
light obj in the 'clouds', we load the cloud level, or we load the overworld
with link on a cloud location - which allows for much faster traversal
up the clouds later! awesome.

*requires two cloud levels, so we have to touch level data and XML>CS pipeline




BURN HOUSES

as in, have burned versions of each house obj that randomly
smoke and rarely collapse (like roofs randomly collapsing).
