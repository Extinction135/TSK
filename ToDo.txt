Today:




Climbing - Part 2

added ladder to game.
fixed sorting of mountain walls over water,
then fixed sorting of footholds and ladders
over mountain walls. this allows for walls
over bodies of water, that are climbable.

added B button press to drop from climbing.
while playing I noticed something very nice:
on the ground and in the water, B button dashes,
but while climbing (which is dangerous) B button
drops the player and makes them start all over
again. this teaches them that they can't rush
(dash) or hurry thru this part of the game.
this teaches them discipline and restraint.

updated mountain top wall sprites, while fixing 
bug with exiting climbing state while at top
of mountain walls.

improved ladder and foothold sprites.
improved mountain wall sprites.









Climbing - Part 3

*need climbing sfx - chest open sfx?
*improve climbing animation - should only animate when hero is moving
this should be based on the compInput of actor.
if the input has any magnitude, play the climb_moving anim,
otherwise play the climb_idle anim.




*pressing A while falling should grab onto nearest foothold.





if actor is falling, they should be able to 
grab a foothold by pressing a button. pressing
a button again afterwards doesn't cancel the
climbing state. so it's ok to spam A while falling
in the hopes of grabbing on. this allows for
assassin's creed style climbing up high to fall
to catch a foothold in an unreachable area,
all based on skill and understanding of the game.


**swim up to a cliff and climb it... yesss.....*****


add a staircase for walking up long distances.




























link up the mountain level to the overworld screen.
add the mountain dungeon's entrance obj.
change the mountain dungeon's wall sprites to be
cave-y. 






update forest standard enemy to be angry floating eye.
- doesn't need swimming state, has same rec as hero,
so he can cast fireballs, etc...


create blob dungeon pit object - this will go on town level.
if hero collides with this obj, he falls into the blob dungeon.
this dungeon builds a critical path to the exit, which
dumps hero back out at last overworld location (or just town level).
-this moves blobs into their own dungeon, without a miniboss or boss.



mountain dungeon++
add mountain enemies, miniboss, boss.
standard enemy is? snake?





























Town++
we are going to rebuild the town level completely..
completely! with a few goals in mind: smaller houses
that are father apart. all roofs fade out when link
enters a house, so we don't want multiple houses on
screen at once. only one. we'll also be creating the
My Chickens! sidequest soon, so create a gated area
for chickens.





*exiting the forest dungeon placed link at colliseum.
it's likely we're not checking to see if link is exiting
a level of id.type dungeon.








Mountain Level
should be able to climb up certain rock walls, denoted with small
footholds. hold A to climb. rockwalls normally push link down (faking
gravity), but while in climbing state the push is ignored. this allows
link to literally climb up the mountain. he can't use any items while,
climbing so link has to dodge enemies until he can get to a landing to
take care of them.

the 1st field level is the basecamp and start of the mountain.
the 2nd field level is the major climbing level, and contains the
entrance to the mountain dungeon.
the 3rd field level is the summit, and contains summit related things. ???
the mountain dungeon entrance is NOT on the summit, because
it would be difficult and time consuming to climb all the way back
up when player has died in the dungeon. at the summit we could
have an overlook - which creates a screen with nice concept art and music.
like the player was looking at hyrule from atop a mountain.







Screens + ScreenManager
migrate screens to be GLOBAL. they will still inherit
from base class of screen, but this way we get to keep
the last selected menuItem, etc... 







*not this, but...*
At the begining of the game, build a complete dungeon in the
background. this causes the game to do all the JIT compilation
at the start, so we don't get an initial hiccup when loading into the
first dungeon. *hopefully* because this only happens on uwp
on xbox one, so i'm assuming the code is compiled differently.

title screen is the menu with input over a level screen
played by an AI. this AI doesn't have to be good. it just
has to move around and attack and explore stuff - and it can't
die. after a period of time, randomly load a different level
or dungeon. should start inside a dungeon.
