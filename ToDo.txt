Gif Capture process:
	run game in release mode
	run LiceCap, expand capture area past program window about 10 pixels on each side
	record at 30fps, open in photoshop and crop the frame down to just the game view (minus window title)
	reduce image size by half, down to original size so pixels are 1:1 ratio
	save as PSD master, then begin cutting out sections/edits
	the default time per frame (set by licecap) is perfect, do not change this
	save for web ->  GIF 32 Dithered, filesize should be under 3mb, loop forever
	test in browser to ensure proper fps
adding music:
	files are saved as .ogg and added to content pipeline, built on high quality.
	keep these files stereo, but at 22k.
adding sound effects:
	sound effects should be compressed down to 22K sample rate, mono, 16bit
VS shortcuts
	CTRL + M, O = collapse functions/regions

v0.8 goals

- mountain dungeon (diff enemies, boss, dungeon sprites)

- Non-room repeating Dungeon, additional rooms
- Blob AI improvements - sword, bomb based on weapon / item loadout 

- room keys - these only work for the room and only unlock 1 door, and
these rooms turn all their doors into locked doors upon close, similar to puzzled rooms
link doesn't put them into inventory - he literally picks them up and walks over
to a locked door then throws the key at it.
this is kinda like super mario world style key gameplay.

if obj.type == key & obj.hitBox.intersects lockedDoor.hitBox,
convert lockedDoor to openDoor, release() key.
- or - we put the key as a menuItem in inventory,
and clear that inventory item when link enters a new room (pre-build).









0.9

- LIGHT WORLD & DARK WORLD
- this is different overworld map + different levels + diff sprites
- this is NOT A SEPARATE SYSTEM (needless complexity)











TODAY:


Prep for 0.72 release and media (target: tmrw night).






Pushing Objs++

only certain objects can be pushed.
this should be modeled via type checks.
right now, we check obj.compMove.moveable,
which is really used to tell if the obj
can be pushed by other objects, like belts.

updated Hero.InteractRecWith(Obj) to use
type checks instead of .moveable boolean check.
this means player can no longer push rats,
turtles, crabs, etc.. fixing that weirdness.

 





add turtles, crabs, and rats to dungeon rooms.






Town
create town level on left side of map.
town level should have a center shop with npcs.
add rats randomly outside around town.




Farmer
we need a farmer npc on the farm level that complains
that his crops are too dry to grow. if he only had a 
shovel..














*we need a sunken obj particle
this should be created whenever an object is 
sunk into water. the sprite is the underwater
sprite, particle has a life of 255 frames, then
creates an attention particle and releases().
this creates the illusion of an object sinking.
we could even have the sprite animated to get smaller!







DungeonMap++
miniboss should drop the dungeon map object.
upon touching this obj, hero should be set into reward
state, with map overhead.



Dash++
holding down B should trigger dashing in the input
direction across frames - this imitates lttps screen
dashing ability, but still keeps the quick tactical
dash from hyper light drifter.





SHADOWS

- hero needs a shadow. this should track to him prior to draw.

- boomerang needs a shadow < this should be done in sprite,
we need to have a spinning animation for boomerang with shadow
added in. this means we dont double up sprites in game for projectiles,
just so a few of them can have shadows. it's more efficient to
just bake the shadows into the sprite sheets.
**problem** the boomerang shadow will sort with the boomerang,
not underneath objects that the boomerang hits.

- fireball should have a shadow too, because the shadow would
help to visually distinguish the fireball in-room, allowing for
an easier visual track for the player (me).
*should probably have cardinal directions for the fireball sprite,
so the shadow is always sorting (down) properly.














TMRW




ENEMIES ++++

Optimization
overworld enemies should NOT be actors.
these simple enemies should just be roomObjs.
this will cut down on frame times for packed 
field levels with lots of objs.

create overworld enemy (with ai that randomly moves)
that is destroyed upon interaction with most
projectiles (explosions, swords, arrows, etc...)

spawns loot too.



Hero Eyeball
we should have "hero eyeballs" for the main mob
in the forest dungeon. this is essentially a big 
eyeball with the proper feet and hand sprites to
fulfill the hero sheet reqs. however, link cannot
become this hero normally in-game.


Enemy Spawns

standard - usually 3 hit.

easy - 1 hit, usually many or they explode.
- we have seekers, they need to be renamed.
- we also have fun floaty eye that should be mob outside of boss room

*hard - more than 3 hits, less than 10.
-we dont have a hard boss for forest dungeon yet.
-make one



Enemies++

Seeker : seeks towards player, exlodes (done)
Standard : 3 hits, with a melee attack (usually sword).

OneHit : fast moving, low melee, low health.
Distance : projectile attack (unlimited), med move, low health.
Healing : healing magic (set amount), med move, no attack.
Aggro : tank, slow, strong melee attack.
Flanking : rogue, weak, fast, with strong attack.

Miniboss : done
Boss : done



we'll need to change the enemy spawn 2, or miniboss spawn to be
Enemy_Spawn_Weak, Enemy_Spawn_Strong. later on, it's likely this 
will expand to also include Enemy_Spawn_Ranged, Enemy_Spawn_Healer,
etc...









Underground Blob Dungeon:
we have an overworld pit sprite.
hide this randomly under an object that can be destroyed,
like a bush on a level. for now, this object will
create a new type of dungeon, an underground dungeon.
this is just a single critical path from hub room to exit room.
just a hub room, then an exit room south of it.
in the hub room, a miniboss will spawn, with a chest.
the chest will have the dungeon map, in case we decide to expand
this dugneon algorithm to be more than 2 rooms in the future.
but, this reverses the dungeon - leading to the exit.
upon exit, we simply return hero to his last overworld location,
which should be stored in save data.
*these dungeons should be blob enemy only, because this is story*


Blobs need to have more weapons & items to attack and use.
can throw bombs. can attack with swords.

























Sneaking

link picks up an obj. holding X while carrying this obj
puts link into the 'sneaking' state, which means link
crouches down and the held obj mostly covers him, except 
for his feet. link moves at a much slower pace, but
enemies cant see him and dont attack him.






Bombos
this is a series of explosions across the screen, rapidly.
this is left to right, top to bottom, with no explosions
touching link or dealing him damage. this magic allows players
to destroy entire levels of objects in a second.
which is awesome.




Fire++
when fire expands, it should expand further vertically,
because it doesn't always transfer from bush to bush,
because bush hitboxes are small.


































Pathing

We need dirt paths, without using alot of sprite space up.
we could do vert transition to dirt + hori trans to dirt,
but never actually have a dirt tile. putting two of these
together could build a path, and then we just need corners.
so, minimum of 4 - likely 6.







HitBoxes++
we're always expanding and contracting the hitBox.
we need dedicated methods for doing this.
we need to override/replace/rewrite xna's rectangle class.
but we need to keep the intersects() and contains() methods,
as they are, as fast as they are.






Exploit : Trap Door Pit Teleport

the majority of what i do as a game developer is deal
with cause and effect, how systems interact, and designing
systems that do their job BUT ALSO get along with the
other systems that exist in the global namespace (ecosphere).

currently the system designed to track what door link
went thru last is causing a problem with the system that
represents the pit's functionality. this occurs in this
particular state, and likely in others:

hero enters a puzzle room where the doors become trap
doors (this is only way to get trap doors). hero moves
to a different trap door, touching it, activating it
as the last door 'entered'. hero is then pushed, or
falls into a pit (maybe with a certain direction).
this causes the pit to pull hero in, then call 
RespawnInCurrentRoom() on the hero, teleporting him
to the last touched door, the 2nd trap door. with
enough inertia, the hero can overcome the trap door's
initial frame of pushing, and link can pop out into
the room on the other side of the 2nd trap door.
i experienced this exploit personally. not sure if
it would work on vertical North/South doors, as
it only happened to me for East/West doors.
this is *likely* what's happening, tho I'm not
exactly sure - but I do know how to fix it.

the fix is simply to remove trap doors from the
routine that sets the last 'touched' door / active door.
in fact, only open doors or bombed doors should be
set as the last / active door.









Commentary
test recording playthru using astro a20s.
can we hook this into OBS? why not?






Boomerang Bug?
ran into lost boomerang bug again.
simply left a room with it bouncing around.



when water spreads to other tiles, it shouldn't play
the water splash soundfx, this takes waaay too long.
it should play the water walk sfx, or we should shorten
the water splash sound fx dramatically. either or.
or we should create a water spreading soundfx,
then use the splash fx shortened. i dunno.

 
 
 
 
 

Improve Projectile.Spawn()

*miniboss cant shoot fireballs south - why?
?= pro.spawn() assumes that the actor's collRec is 16x16 - it shouldn't.
this means only 16x16 actors can safely shoot fireballs without damaging
themselves, which is some valve level stupid. this method should take
the actor as a parameter, and then we should base the offsets FOR ALL
PROJECTILES off of the actor's collision rec width and height. this
would allow larger actors, like bosses, to SHOOT FIREBALLS. geez.

Special Attacks / Boss "USE"
bigeye uses the shut + bloodshot frames for his special.
bigeye: spawns A TON of exploding seekers while in his special.











we can handle plot/level changes like this:
we have a boolean that represents this levels state.
false loads xml data A. true loads xml data B.
the differece between A and B represents something
that happened in the story, or something the player did.
-perhaps the player killed an NPC.
-perhaps the player irrigated a farmers crops (B would have filled ditches, A wouldn't).
-theres alot we can do here.






Boomerang++
*boomerang should only create attention particles upon hit if
it's traveling away from hero. if it's returning to hero (it's lifecounter)
then it shouldn't create ANY attention particles. this fixes
the visual bug where it can create a ton of pops when hitting
objs from certain angles / directions.




Metal Gear ++
if you're carrying an obj and press B while not moving, link
should squat down and the heldObj should sort mostly over his head,
and he should flip the actor.hidden boolean. then update functions_AI
to check the actor.hidden boolean instead of the actor.underwater
boolean. then update the underwater rountines to set the actor.hidden
boolean to true when actor dives underwater. the net effect of these
changes is that the hero will be able to hide underwater, underwater
while carrying an obj, or on land while carrying an obj. 
being able to hide on land while carrying an obj is more metal gear
than being able to dive while holding an obj. lol.



in hard mode, pits should deal 1 damage.
in normal mode, pits deal no damage.



A ReThink

Do minibosses and bosses need to be actors? they could be roomObjs.
seekers def should be roomObjs instead of actors. then we can
place them easily inside rooms.

it seems the only enemies that need to be actors are
enemies that can chase hero thru water. if an enemy flys,
then they should be a roomObj enemy. so for now, only blobs
and link are actors. everything else is a roomObj.







*consider that actors may need interaction points*
*needed if actors want to pickup or dig, and it would be nice to see that
with more advanced enemies later on*
migrate hero's interaction rec and interaction rec functions into actor class.
