Prep for 0.74 Release

during a playthru recording, several issues
were noticed and fixed...

fixed a major issue with pets removing
roomObjects when spawning inside dungeon
rooms - they were overlapping a wall, which
was removing the wall.

fixed an issue where open building
doors couldn't be destroyed.

updated roomObj enemies to instantly die
if they go beyond the room's rec. link
wouldn't be able to chase them or kill
them, plus it looks really weird to see
a rat running around outside the dungeon
room in total darkness. this is the same
check used for fairies too.

Part1
