the UWP project will build, but fail to run properly the first time.
this is because the RoomData folder & contents don't exist in the Debug/AppX folder.
the project WILL RUN properly upon a second build. why? read on...

the deployment process for UWP app overwrites the AppX folder.
this deployment happens after the BUILD process, so the RoomData in AppX is deleted.
so it goes: Build -> RoomData copied to AppX. Deploy -> AppX dir overwritten completely.
upon second run: Build -> RoomData copeid to AppX. Deploy -> No changes to AppX dir, RoomData preserved.

there is no way to copy RoomData AFTER DEPLOYMENT <- thats the ideal solution..
so, the workaround is simply to debug/deploy the project TWICE.
the second time the project/program runs, everything works as expected.
