the UWP project will (usually) build and run.
if it doesn't it's because I haven't ported a change from the DirectX version
to the UWP version yet - or because the UWP's content folder is missing something
new that I added to the DirectX version.

in previous versions, the game used external XML files. due to the UWP deployment
process, this approach was modified to use binary data instead. the 'pipeline' for
converting the xml roomData to c# code is handled entirely by the DirectX project.
the UWP method that is called is empty and will remain empty for the time being.

6 months later - this will remain true for the time being.
