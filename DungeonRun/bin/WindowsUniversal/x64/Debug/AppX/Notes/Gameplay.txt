Dungeon Run



Player battles through a dungeon collecting loot and items.
Upon completion Player gets an overall score + additional loot.
This loot is used to purchase upgrades + items from a shop.
Player then chooses another dungeon to complete.


There is no 'overworld' to explore.
Player chooses the location to visit, either a dungeon or the shop.
This choice is made from a "navigation" screen that resembles an overworld map.
The shop isn't a level, it's a screen with a shop-like background + menu for purchasing.

Dungeons are the only real 'levels' in the game.
Dungeons and how the player controls the Hero are based on Zelda.
Top down, action-adventure, with weapons + items + loadouts.
Dungeons are composed of a series of rooms, culminating in a boss fight.
Each room is composed of enemies + objects.
In order to beat a dungeon, the hero must find the boss key, then open the boss door, then defeat the boss.
Dungeons are "single servings" - randomly generated, not saved.
Exiting the dungeon takes the player back to the navigation screen.
Beating a dungeon (or dying) displays the score screen.

The Score Screen displays how much time the player has spent in the dungeon,
if the player was successful or failed (died), additional score bonuses based
on enemies killed, completion time, loot found, damage taken, etc...
Additional loot is rewarded based various factors.

The Shop Screen displays a selection of items and upgrades the player can purchase.
Some objects required gold, other items require different currency.
Any upgrades or items purchased are included in the player's save file.
Progress can never be lost - so there is only 1 save file for the game.

The Title screen displays the Game Logo and basic menu options.
The Options screen contains UI for managing sound, display, game input, etc...
