the UWP project will (usually) build and run.
if it doesn't it's because I haven't ported a change from the DirectX version
to the UWP version yet - or because the UWP's content folder is missing something
new that I added to the DirectX version.

in previous versions, the game used external XML files. due to the UWP deployment
process, this approach was modified to use binary data instead. the 'pipeline' for
converting the xml roomData to c# code is handled entirely by the DirectX project.
the UWP method that is called is empty and will remain empty for the time being.

6 months later - this will remain true for the time being.

+2 months later - the uwp project is now only linked to full level data.
this means it's really big, and only going to get bigger, so whatever ide is
trying to work with it is going to have a hard time. the directx version is 
the primary dev version, and it's linked to the empty leveldata files, which
allows the project to build faster and dev easier. in other words, the uwp
project is not setup to be developer friendly. it's setup for release testing.
use the Dx project if you want a dev friendly setup that makes understanding
the codebase much easier.
