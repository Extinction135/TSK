Overall Theme

"along the path of killing the ones you hate,
you will kill the ones you love, and ultimately
end up alone, with everything you want."












#Setup - intro + cutscenes

After Link touched the Triforce, he disappeared.
All paths to the dark world vanished
Hyrule entered into a new Golden Age.
A golden age, which ended suddenly in War.
Hyrule fell to the army of dark knights.
Queen Zelda was taken hostage by the new king.
the shadow king..

and darkness flowed from the sacred realm once more...









Why is Link returning to Hyrule?
link awakens to the cry of zelda asking link for help.
but, zelda isn't in any trouble - zelda wants link to return 
so she can sacrifice him in a ritual to bring back ganon,
in which she needs the blood of the hero of hyrule. she
does this because she has been corrupted by dark magic, 
via ganon and her trauma at the hands of him. she seeks
power and control, because she had none when she was young.
she watched as her friends were sacrificed, and won't let that
be her fate.

the dark knights show up when ganon's possession of zelda
was complete. then he used zelda to conjur up the shadow king
to rule hyrule as ganon's suurrogate.














#Cutscene - Link's Return

link standing on the front of a large boat, looking towards an island.
boat sails slowly, wind blowing. distance shot.
"after 25 years, link returns to hyrule..."








Section 1

#Landing

Link arrives at Hyrule island, starting on the ship.
Player is given no direction at all, like Zelda 1.
This is a game about exploration, secrets, and layers of deceit.
So, give the player an honest first impression: you're on you're own.
The ship captain should tell link exactly that:
'from here on out, traveler - you're on you're own.'

*in link's inventory is a poster for hyrule's tournament.
*this tournament decides the new 'hero of hyrule'
*the tournament takes place at the colliseum
*viewing the poster tells the player all the info they need to know
*this also tells player that their inventory screen is actually important

link has internal dialog with himself & player:
'a new hero of hyrule?..'
'i'm the only hero hyrule needs...'



#OPEN MAP

At this point, the player can do ALOT of stuff non-linearly.
So the story has to split in multiple linear storylines that don't really
overlap or touch at all, otherwise they can affect each other and it gets
really complicated really fast, and that's hard to do well.

there are many other places open on the map initially.
but some of them are closed, the inside of the castle city, for example.
the city gate will be closed until link wins the tournament.
at that point, the royal city is open.	


#MAIN PLOT

to enter hyrule's tournament, link must be qualified as a
true hyrulian warrior by possessing pendants from the 3 world dungeons.
or, at least that's what the tournament NPC tells link.

the 3 dungeons are:
forest
cave/mountain
desert

this 3 pendant lightworld openmap approach is a BIG BITE from lttp.
once link collects all 3 pendants, he talks to the tournament NPC
again, who tells him:
'i was just kidding about those 3 pendants. it's really just
99 rupees to buy the colliseum pass. cool trinkets, tho.'
- and then the player has to pay 99 rupees.
*note: the player DOES have to have the pendants to get into the 
tournament. the proper dialog won't trigger without them. this
dialog is really just altering the player's trust in the game, 
and getting the player to realize that they shouldn't trust NPCs,
situations are more adult and misleading.
**the pendants serve a different purpose later in the game,
so they stay in the hero's inventory for now.


#King'sTournament

king's tournament is a series of boss fights, and MOST of these fights are against
bosses that only exist in this tournament, so the player can't 'train' beforehand.
they have to adapt or grind. these bosses are specific and unique.

After the boss battles, link 'wins' the tournament.
* the city gate opens. city levels become available.
* royal vendors become available.
* link is told to go see the king for his reward.

once link completes the tournament, defeating the last boss, the castle is
made available to Link. in link's inventory is an invitation to speak with
the king. the objective is for link to get to the throne room, where the
king and queen zelda are waiting.



#KingFight

link meets with the queen and king in the castle, 
where the king challenges link to a duel.
(keep in mind zelda is controlling the king)

k: 'zelda has told me the truth, link.' (zelda is rewriting history)
k: 'how she helped you...' (how she was powerless)
k: 'how you were ganon's pawn...' (she was ganon's helpless pawn)
k: 'how you fell in love with her...' (she loved link, and wanted his love in return)
k: 'your story amuses me, link.' (she wants to be part of link's story)
k: 'a peasant boy with magical toys..' (but link isn't of royal blood)
k: 'let's see if you have any royal blood in you!' (but link isn't of royal blood!!!)
k: 'en garde!' (get ready to fight)

link battles the king.
keep in mind that Zelda has engineered this entire encounter and is speaking thru
The Shadow King TO Link. His dialog is really HER dialog to LINK, regarding her fears,
hopes, and wishes. she wants link back. she wants to return to 'sanity', but she doesn't
know how, so she only exerts more control over her world and her subjects.
that's what makes his final dialog so elegant in regards to moving the plot along.
reading this initially, it just reads like a dumb video game character.
once you know the backstory and context, it's really Zelda toying with Link,
twisting facts, making things one sided, removing his importance / status, etc..

*link defeats the king*

k: 'i trusted her, link...' (the REAL king speaks, then dies)
*here the king is telling link that the king was decieved by zelda.
and that ultimately was his un-doing.

(zelda begins to re-spin the narrative)
z: 'i'm sorry to have put you through that, link...'
z: 'i had to make sure you were still the true hero of hyrule..'
z: 'the truth is.. difficult to admit.. the king was possessed by dark magic..'
z: 'the same dark magic that flowed from the triforce so many years ago..'
z: 'i fear the darkworld has grown powerful again..'
z: 'but instead of power, this time ganon has chosen to use cunning and deceit..'
z: 'trust no-one link, except me. ganon could possess any of them.'
z: 'do you trust me, link? do you still love me?'

l: 'zelda... you seem very different...'
z: 'if you don't trust me, then just say so, link...'
l: 'zelda, that's not what i'm saying...'
z: 'if you don't trust me, link, then how do i know ganon hasn't possessed you?'
l: 'zelda, calm down. i never said i don't trust you..'
z: 'you've said all you needed to say, link - or ganon? whoever you are..'
l: 'zelda - what's happened to you? to hyrule?'
z: 'it's not about what's already happened, link...'
z: 'it's about what's going to happen... what's coming...'
z: 'en garde, my love.'

*zelda dissappears*
*explosions are created all around the room until link dies*
the level.id is set to be the dark world castle, and the level
exit action is set to level. eventually, link dies, progressing
the story to the next chapter: The Dark World.

yeah, zelda literally kills link (instead of link killing light
world ganon to get to dark world). 
this completes section 1 of the game.

*note that link has been killed at this point, and is technically dead*












Transition

black screen.
after a while, a dialog pops up - it's shahasrala's face
telling link to 'wake up, link...'
'wake up, link...'
'wake up link!'










Section 2 - The Dark World

Link 'wakes up' in the dark world.
he is in bed at shahasrala's house, who is a ghost.
s: 'i'm glad you chose to live. you were dead for a few days.'
shahasrala explains the true plot of the game to link:

years ago, zelda sacrificed shahasrala to gain dark power.
sha's spirit was able to live on in the dark world in ethereal form.
he suspected that zelda was possessed by ganon's spirit,
slowly turning her into his puppet. then using zelda, ganon controlled
the king, and finally hyrule. ganon is dead, yes. but his spirit lives
on in the AfterWorld, where he can still telepathically contact
other people. even though ganon's spirit is weak, he is still pursuing
pieces of the triforce. if ganon collects all the pieces of the
triforce, he will return to his physical form with almost 
unlimited power and knowledge. there is no-one else able to
stop him - other than you, link. you are our only hope.
and i fear that zelda may be one of ganon's pawns now too.
she accussed me of treason, and i was sacrificed in a dark ritual.

sha gives link a new objective: 
gain access to the AfterWorld and trap ganon's spirit,
so that he cannot influence anyone anymore.

How does this play out?
link collects the other 3 pendants.
link breaks the seal to the darkworld castle.
link defeats dark zelda.
link travels to the river of the dead.
the ferryman rows link across, with zelda's soul as the fee.
ferryman tells link the dead can have one passenger,
but there's no coming back once link travels to AfterWorld.
link travels to the AfterWorld - see Section 3.



so, link fights dark zelda and kills her.
Dark Zelda is at the darkworld castle, deep in the throne room.
this is a dungeon, leading to boss fight with dark zelda.

we also have 3 other dungeons in the dark world:
swamp/water
graveyard
ice temple

the darkworld castle has been sealed with magic,
which can only be broken by the 6 pendants. the other
3 pendants need to be collected before link can access
the darkworld castle's interior.

link collects the additional 3 pendants, breaks the
castle seal, fights to the throne room and confronts
the dark queen, who explains who she really is:

dq: 'i am the queen. the rightful ruler of hyrule.'
++:	'... i'm not the princess you saved so long ago, link.'

dq: 'that girl was hunted. kidnapped... tortured.'
++: 'i did what i had to do to survive.'

dq: 'When did you first see the dark world?'
++: 'When did you first feel death?'

dq: 'as a child i saw monsters tear my friends apart.'
++: '..while you were playing with boomerangs, link..'

dq: 'my what paths we travel, my love.'
++: '... why are you here, link?...'

link: '...to see you, zelda. ...to save you. again.
++: 'one last time..'

dq: 'your little princess doesn't need saving anymore.'
dq: '...you should save yourself instead. ...goodbye, link.'

link: 'don't make me do this, zelda...'

link and zelda fight an intense battle, 
with link winning. they have their final dialog:

link: '...zelda.. i'm here..'
z: 'link? you saved me.. again..'
z: 'from ganon.. from myself..'
z: 'and i've never.. been there for you..'
link: 'i can't -'
z: 'listen to me link..'
z: 'i have always loved you.'
z: 'i knew you would return..'
z: 'you're the only one, link..'
z: 'the true hero of hyrule..'
z: '...'

link: 'zelda...'
++: '...goodbye.'

then you hear ganon's laugh... and a dialog pops up with ganon as speaker:
g: 'no use crying over her.. she wasn't that special.'
g: 'hahahahahahahaha...'

shahasrala contacts link telepathically:
s: 'i've located ganon... he's in the AfterWorld..'
+: 'neither a place of life or death.. a place of spirits..'

s: 'cross the river of death, enter the AfterWorld...'
+: 'then use the soul crystal to trap ganon..'

s: 'from there, you're on you're own, link..'
+: 'i won't be able to contact you..'

link respawns on overworld map at darkworld castle.
*note: zelda's soul, in a soul crystal, is now in link's inventory.
link must now get a soul crystal, then travel to the AfterWorld.
the expected path is to explore and talk to the npcs.


NPCs
Hecate should be the name of a dark world vendor,
specializing in magic, witchcraft, poisons, ghosts,
necromancy and sorcery. she should be shown holding
a pair of torches or a key, and can be shown in triple
form as well. she is also associated with crossroads,
and entrance-ways. she will sell link a soul crystal,
for a price. she wants link to trap various enemies
for her first, and once link traps those enemies (in 
bottles) and returns them to Hecate, she gives him
a soul crystal strong enough to contain ganon.
there could even be 3 hecates spread across the darkworld,
each selling different items.

Hermes, with a golden wand, offers advice to link,
'to leave the world of the living, one must cross the river'.
hermes is just an npc somewhere in the darkworld.

The DarkWorld Colliseum is judged by the 3 judges,
Minos, Rhad, and Acus. these NPCs present the dark
world colliseum challenges. acus is known was the guardian
of the keys, rhad is known as the lord of heaven, and
minos is known as tie-breaker.





















Section 3 - The AfterWorld

How does Link get here? by crossing The River of Fire.

the river acheron, is the river of pain. (it's also on fire)
the ferryman, charon rows the dead over, and requires a soul as payment.
link simply needs to speak with charon to cross, if zelda's dead.

if link comes here, and zelda isn't dead, then:
this river is patrolled by centaurs,
who shoot arrows of fire at those who try to cross it.
the river itself is on fire, and lights link on fire as well.
it will kill link if he trys to cross it, and crossing
it doesn't load the next level or progress the story.
the ferryman must reach a certain position to
progress the story, which means link must activate him properly.
and the ferryman is only built if zelda is dead.

this is ONE LEVEL, changed based on zeldasDead boolean. 
it's available from the dark world, but not directly
accessible from the overworld. first, link must travel 
to a location, then find a specific object that will
load The River of the Dead.




What is The AfterWorld?

in the AfterWorld, actors don't take damage.
so they don't die. they get pushed, and they can be
knocked off into pits, etc.. but they can't be killed
as normal. this reduces the loot dropped too.
plus, most actors in the AfterWorld are ethereal and flying.
or ghosts. so link can walk right thru them.

most objects are ethereal too, and can be walked thru.
to this extent - there are no dungeons in the soulworld.
but there are vast field levels, with interesting stuff.
but it's mostly non-blocking objects, with transparency.
like a world of liquid glass.



link gets to ganon's level.
the dialog is simple and quick - assume the
player will be repeating this a few times, as
it's the hardest battle in the game.

l: 'it's time to die, ganon.'

g: 'time... what is time, my boy?'
g: 'the perception of change? an idea?'
g: 'i live outside of time. outside of you.'
g: 'you can't stop time, and you can't stop me.'

l: 'my sword disagrees..'
l: 'and your speeches bore me... en garde!'

ganon changes into beast form #1.
final ganon battle begins.



link defeats ganon, they have their final conversation.
link is left to escape the AfterWorld, which is done using
orpheus' lyre, a musical instrument that will put cerberus
to sleep.


once link escapes the soulworld, he returns to the lightworld.
for now, that's the end.









//other places




What is the Colliseum?

a room that contains NPCs and objects which 
lead to challenges or sub-games within the main overall 
game. these challenges are separate from the main game 
and do not / cannot affect plotlines in any meaningful 
way. there will also be a dark world colliseum, with 
darker and different challenges. these challenges take
place in the spectator's pit. the colliseum is open to
any warrior brave enough to enter.

Side Quests / ENDGAME activities: 

colliseum betting
tournaments, 
blob questline, 
purchase houses/businesses/etc
various special item quests.	
hidden simple dungeons / minibosses.

"loot caves" - secret entrances hidden in levels and dungeons that are mini-dungeons 
sequential rooms, with special bosses in each room, beating the loot cave returns hero to overworld
these entrances actually look like caves, and can be hidden behind cracked walls


	
	
	


Tournaments, & Dungeons

Tournament
at colliseum, link can fight mobs and/or gladiators to earn money.
player can also bet money on other gladiator battles, or on their own battles.
when two AI gladiators fight, the battle playsout in realtime, using AI.
gladiators have stats, loadouts, fighting history, etc..
gladiator AI also has fighting styles: aggressive, disciplined, defensive
gladiators also have backstories, and names.

NPCs
various npcs are scattered throughout shops and locations.
NPCs in the shops explain aspects of inventory and stuff.
other NPCs fill out the game world's backstory and discuss major characters.








Blob SideStoryline

So link becomes a blob, and theres a blob vendor level
to get to the blob vendor level, you need to travel thru a small pipe
as a blob, this is easy. as a human, this is not possible.
this pipe level appears after all 4 crystals have been obtained.
inspecting the pipe as link displays a dialog 'i can't fit into that small, slimy pipe'.
inspecting the pipe as blob displays a dialog 'here we go!', and loads blob town.
exiting blob town places hero at the pipe level on overworld map.

the blobs arent actually bad guys, they've just been lumped in with the bad guys
they are kidnapped and forced to fight in the colliseum or live as slaves
because the blobs can't communicate with the humans, everybody assumes they're just evil
thus the blob's storyline is simply to fight in the queen's tournament and win
upon winning, the blob will wish that his people be recognized and set free.
the blob's journey is then one of learning about the blob's history 
+ forming emotional bonds with blob NPCs
the blob challenge is simple: slower movement, leading to much harder dungeons + bosses
