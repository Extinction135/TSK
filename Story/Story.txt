#Backstory

after link touches the triforce, all paths to the dark world
were sealed. Hyrule entered into a state of unparalled prosperity,
a golden age, which ended suddenly with the invasion of the Kondo clan.

unprepared for such a battle, Hyrule fell to the Kondo clan,
and Princess Zelda married King Masa, the Kondo Clan's leader.
When King Masa learned of Link, a reward was put out for him.
Link fled his homeland, Hyrule, sailing across the seas.

For years, Link simply traveled. Trying to forget.
Then one day he sees the Hyrule Tournament Poster.

Meanwhile in Hyrule...
Hyrule's inhabitants rebelled, and martial law was declared.
The people turned against the king, and the queen, and were met
with crushing force. Kakariko village was razed to the ground,
and many villagers died or lost their homes. Queen Zelda
disappeared into the castle, never leaving, rarely being seen.

Unable to organize, the people of hyrule submitted to King Masa.
Broken and hungry, they were fed and sheltered by the King.
A colliseum was built, and the people were entertained.
The King provided the people jobs, homes, and families.
The people slowly began to love the King. 

Then one day the King fell sick. All the king's healers couldn't
fix him. People traveled from lands far away to cure him,
but there was nothing they could do, and King Masa died.
The Queen wept by his side for days, until a shadow rose
from King Masa's body. It summoned the wisemen and the warriors.
As they appeared, the shadow became King Masa, and it spoke to them.
It told them of an afterlife. A world beyond ours, where death
wasn't the end. Where one could live forever.. The Dark World...








#Scene1 - Spark

Link finds a poster advertising The Shadow King's Tournament.
The Winner receives richs, land, and a meeting with the King and Queen.
A meeting with Queen Zelda. After 20 years. Links decides to go.
link travels back to hyrule to compete in the King's tournament.









#Scene2 - Training

Link arrives at the Coliseum. This is where 'training' happens.

Quest: Complete Training

"you know what you're doing, right?" - colliseum npc
A) yes B) no -> training dialog

this teaches the player the basics of the game, like movement, attacking, item usage.
player fights thru a few rooms leading up to a simple boss.
these rooms teach the player BASICS about items too - using boomerangs to trigger things for example.
of using bombs to blow statues up. etc..
upon beating the boss, link is rewarded with the Colliseum Pass.
this gives Link access to the other features of the Colliseum.
more importantly, this ends the level and opens the overworld map up to the player.
link spawns at the colliseum.


#Scene3 - OPEN MAP
At this point, the player can do ALOT of stuff non-linearly.
So the story has to split in multiple linear storylines that don't really
overlap or touch at all, otherwise they can affect each other and it gets
really complicated really fast, and that's hard to do in code.. honestly.

there are many other places open on the map initially.
but some of them are closed, the inside of the castle city, for example.
the city gate will be closed until link wins the tournament.
at that point, the royal city is open.	













#MAIN PLOT
to enter hyrule's tournament, link must be qualified as a
true hyrulian warrior by possessing crystals from the 3 world dungeons.

forest
cave (mountain)
water
(desert dungeon is optional)

once link is a hyrulian warrior, he is granted access to the king's tournament.





however, this tournament becomes easier with each additional crystal link collects.
for example, link will fight the bosses from the swamp, graveyard, and ice dungeons
if he doesn't have those crystals. so, completing those optional dungeons makes
the 3rd act climax a little easier to get through. however, these dungeons are
in the dark world, and they are noticeably harder than their light world equivalents.

swamp
graveyard
ice







king's tournament is a series of boss fights, and MOST of these fights are against
bosses that only exist in this tournament, so the player can't 'train' beforehand.
they have to adapt or grind. these bosses are specific and unique.

After the boss battles, link 'wins' the tournament.
* the city gate opens. city levels become available.
* royal vendors become available.

once link completes the tournament, defeating the last boss, the castle is
made available to Link. this should be like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory -
a mysterious, but frankly scary place where weird evil stuff happens.

entering into the castle, link finds that the castle servants are all dark world
demons, and they attack him as if he were in the dark world, because the castle
is essentially part of the dark world at this point. so in the dark world, it's the
same as it is in the light world. the light world version is 'gone'.
**the castle acts as the primary 'gateway' between the dark and light worlds**

link fights through the castle to the throne room to face the King and Queen.

Prior to meeting, link can access the royal vendors, where special loot exists.
link meets with the queen and king in the castle, where the king challenges link to a duel.
(keep in mind zelda is controlling the king)

k: 'zelda has told me the truth, link.'
k: 'how she helped you fight ganon...'
k: 'how you fell in love with her...'
k: 'your childish affections amuse me, link.'
k: 'do you think she's yours?' (this is zelda asking link if he loves her)
k: 'do you still love her? did you return to see her? hahaha..' 
k: 'she's my wife and your queen, peasant. en garde!'

link battles the king.
keep in mind that Zelda has engineered this entire encounter and is speaking thru
The Shadow King TO Link. His dialog is really HER dialog to LINK, regarding her fears,
hopes, and wishes. she wants link back. she wants to return to 'sanity', but she doesn't
know how, so she only exerts more control over her world and her subjects.
that's what makes his final dialog so elegant in regards to moving the plot along.
reading this initially, it just reads like a dumb video game character.
once you know the backstory and context, it's really Zelda toying with Link,
twisting facts, making things one sided, removing his importance / status, etc..

when the king dies, Zelda and The Dark Queen battle for psycological control
for a moment in a very bipolar dialog that exposes her mental state more obviously.
- this defeat is annoying for the dark queen. 
- this defeat is joyous for queen zelda, who pleads with link to keep fighting and 
rescue her from the dark queen's grasp. 
this bi-polar dialog should be presented with two different queen sprites to really 
emphasize that these are TWO different people occupying the same body.

dq: 'well look at the peasant boy, with his fancy toys.'
dq: 'hasn't he grown into quite the hero...'
z:	'link! help! i've lost control-'
dq:	'oh my. such outbursts won't be tolerated'
(the dark queen damages herself)

dq: 'i am the queen. the rightful ruler of hyrule.'
dq:	'... i'm not the princess you saved so long ago, link.'
dq: 'that girl was hunted. kidnapped... tortured.'
dq: '...have you ever seen the dark world?'
dq: 'as a child, i saw monsters tear my friends apart.'
dq: '...while you were playing with boomerangs, link...'
- dramatic pause -

dq: 'why are you here?'
dq: 'some idealistic pursuit of love? fame? justice?'
link: '...to see you, zelda. 
link: '...to save you. again.'
link: 'one last time..'

dq: 'your little princess doesn't need saving anymore.'
dq: '...you should save yourself instead.'
dq: '...goodbye, link.'

link: 'don't make me do this, zelda...'

link and zelda fight an intense battle, with link mortally wounding her.
they have their final dialog:

link: '...zelda.. i'm here..'
z: 'link? you saved me.. again..'
z: 'from ganon.. from myself..'
z: 'and i've never.. been there for you..'
link: 'i can't -'
z: 'listen to me link..'
z: 'i have always loved you.'
z: 'i knew you would return..'
z: 'you're the only one, link..'
z: 'the only one who ever... truly..'
z: '...mattered...'
z: '...'

link: 'zelda...'
link: '...'
link: '...i love you too...'
link: '...goodbye.'

then you hear ganon's laugh... and a dialog pops up with a questionmark speaker
and the text 'hahahahah... hahahahahaha....'
(alluding to the idea that someone was behind it all along.)

(cutscene to outside castle daytime)
(the castle explodes, a crater is there instead with a portal to the dark world)
(this is reflected in the overworld map)

**this new dark world portal is the primary / only way to travel between these two worlds**

link wakes up in the dark world, next to the light world 'rift' that has been
torn open by zelda's death. also the light world castle is now destroyed.
but link can travel through this rift anytime he wants to. when link wakes up,
shahasrala telepathically contacts him, giving him his first dark world goal:
find shahasrala, speak with him, learn the truth about zelda.
"if you want to know the truth about zelda - come find me. -shahasrala".

goals:
find and talk with shahasrala.
defeat the legendary beasts, unlocking ganon's tower.
confront + defeat ganon.



ganon's tower is protected by a magical seal.
this seal is broken only by using the runestones protected by
the legendary beasts. link must travel to their lairs, defeat 
the beasts, get the runestones, then open ganon's tower.

ganon's tower is the last dungeon, and as such is the most challenging.
things are in a state of disrepair, so even the rooms try to kill link.

eventually link gets to ganon, and ganon presents as a frail old man, 
who resorts to mental trickery (the willy wonka). the idea here being that
ganon won't fight link or even reveal his plans to link, to keep link in 
the dark. the only way ganon would reveal himself and fight link is if
link betrays his pure/idealistic nature, meaning that ganon has won that
intellectual / moral battle - he has finally corrupted link.

old ganon: 'i've been waiting for you a very long time, link.'
og: 'but i am an old man now.. unable to fight you, my friend.'
og: 'won't you chat with me for a while?'
(continue to talk with Ganon A)
(leave the old man alone B) - ends dialog

link: 'i know what you've done, ganon.'
og: 'what now?... what do you know, link?'
og: 'tell me.. what have I done?'
(accuse ganon of corrupting zelda A)
(nevermind... B)

B og: 'i corrupted her? tell me, how would an old man like me do that..'
B og: 'why would i?..'
(A i've spoken with shahasrala, he's told me everything.) - requires shahasrala boolean true.
(B i have no proof, but i know your vile stench when i smell it.)
B og: 'unfortunately, my smell isn't a crime. without proof, you're just a liar.'
B og: 'what a wonderful day! hahahahahaha...' (dialog ends)

**any A based response continues the dialog, we may add more later**

A og: 'shahasrala... the untouchable thread by which my plans are laid bare...'
(musical tone changes to dark ominous)
A og: '...when zelda killed him, i thought my corruption of her was complete..'
A og: 'it was only later that i realized she did so to hide him from me..'
A og: '..to keep him protected so that you would one day know the truth...'
A og: 'one day you would know that she had lost control, that it was me behind it all.'
link: 'in that context, you failed to corrupt her completely, ganon.'
link: 'she still had love inside. she resisted you, and you lost yet again.'
link: '..and you will continue to lose.. as is your destiny.'
og: 'a destiny shared with you - link. we. we will continue to lose.'
og: 'you see ..when the triforce granted my wish, it unbalanced the light and dark.'
og: 'the triforce created you in order to restore that balance. to bring light, order. to destroy me.'
og: '..and once that balance is restored, you will become that which unbalances the worlds.'
og: 'if you kill me, you will become the evil that inhabits the dark world.'
og: '..and one day a heroic warrior will hunt you.. as you have hunted me..'
link: 'you're wrong, ganon.. your choices are what made you evil - not fate.'
link: 'your plans brought you here, crippled and alone. you blame everyone, but yourself.'
link: 'you are incapable of change or progress, my old friend...'

(at this point Ganon changes in beast ganon form, music is now high-intensity boss music)
bg: 'bwahahahahah! i'm incapable of change, he says. wrong again, link.'
bg: 'you're merely a pawn in my plans. you've brought the dark runestones, right?'
bg: 'good. i'll need those to break the seal to the light world. thanks.'
bg: '..oh, you thought i simply wanted revenge? no, my dear boy. i want it all.'
bg: 'now give me your life. en garde!'
(final battle begins with beast form ganon).

this is the most epic battle in zelda history, and should be the primary focus
of 1.0 development. this is a multi stage battle that initially takes place in ganon's
tower, but as the fight progresses ganon pulls link through all kinds of timelines and
worlds. it should be almost be laughable how much stuff happens in this battle.

Tournaments, & Dungeons

Tournament
at colliseum, link can fight mobs and/or gladiators to earn money.
player can also bet money on other gladiator battles, or on their own battles.
when two AI gladiators fight, the battle playsout in realtime, using AI.
gladiators have stats, loadouts, fighting history, etc..
gladiator AI also has fighting styles: aggressive, disciplined, defensive
gladiators also have backstories, and names.

NPCs
various npcs are scattered throughout shops and locations.
NPCs in the shops explain aspects of inventory and stuff.
other NPCs fill out the game world's backstory and discuss major characters.








Blob SideStoryline

So link becomes a blob, and theres a blob vendor level
to get to the blob vendor level, you need to travel thru a small pipe
as a blob, this is easy. as a human, this is not possible.
this pipe level appears after all 4 crystals have been obtained.
inspecting the pipe as link displays a dialog 'i can't fit into that small, slimy pipe'.
inspecting the pipe as blob displays a dialog 'here we go!', and loads blob town.
exiting blob town places hero at the pipe level on overworld map.

the blobs arent actually bad guys, they've just been lumped in with the bad guys
they are kidnapped and forced to fight in the colliseum or live as slaves
because the blobs can't communicate with the humans, everybody assumes they're just evil
thus the blob's storyline is simply to fight in the queen's tournament and win
upon winning, the blob will wish that his people be recognized and set free.
the blob's journey is then one of learning about the blob's history + forming emotional bonds with blob NPCs
the blob challenge is simple: slower movement, leading to much harder dungeons + bosses
